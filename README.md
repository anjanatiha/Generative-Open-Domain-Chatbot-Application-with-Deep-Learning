##### Domain             : Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing
##### Sub-Domain         : Deep Learning, Conversational Agent, Language Modeling
##### Techniques         : Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq), Recurrent Neural Network, Bidirectional RNN, LSTM, Neural Attention Mechanism, Beam Search, Neural Machine Translation, TensorFlow


### Description
1. Developed chatbot using encoder and decoder based Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model from Google’s Neural Machine Translation (NMT) module and Cornell Movie Subtitle Corpus. 
2. Seq2Seq architecture built on Recurrent Neural Network and was optimized with bidirectional LSTM cells.
3. Enhanced chatbot performance by applying Neural Attention Mechanism and Beam Search.
4. Developed backend using Python and front-end using Python and PyQT.
