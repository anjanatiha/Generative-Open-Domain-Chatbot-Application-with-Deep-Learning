i'm fucking serious . it's fucking over . us . this is no joke . i don't think we should see each other anymore .
but your friends are my friends . my friends are your friends . i don't think it would work . you have a little something on your upper lip .
i know that your friends are my friends . i've thought about that . you can have them .
you're really serious , aren't you ?
yes , i am .
but what about the past ? our past ?
we never really shared one .
you're inhuman .
i'm . in touch with humanity . evelyn , i'm sorry . you're just not terribly important to me .
no , no , no .
if you really want to do something for me , you can stop making this scene right now .
oh god , i can't believe this .
i'm leaving now . i've assessed the situation and i'm going .
where are you going ?
i'm just leaving .
but where ?
i haven't seen you around here .
you just haven't been looking .

i'm not supposed to . but i can make an exception .
do you take american express ?
you have a really nice place here . paul . how much did you pay for it ?
actually , that's none of your business , christie , hut i can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap .
i'm not so sure about this . i had to go to emergency after last time .
oh this won't be anything like last time , i promise .
i don't think so .
nothing like last time , promise .
alright .
so , you're looking great , how have you been ?
well , i actually might need a little surgery after last time .

my friend told me i should maybe even get a lawyer .
oh , lawyers are so complicated don't do that . here .
this is nicer than your other apartment .
listen , what are you doing tonight ?
what ? oh , i'm . busy .
listen , you're dating luis , he's in arizona . you're fucking me , and we haven't made plans . what could you possibly be up to tonight ?
stop it . i'm .
on a lot of lithium ?
waiting for luis to call me . he said he'd call tonight . oh don't be difficult , patrick .
am i confused or were we talking about tonight ?
ummm . . yeah . luis is calling me tonight . i need to be home for that .
pumpkin ?
yes ?
pumpkin you're dating an asshole .
uh huh .
pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in new york .
i know . stop it .
pumpkin , you're dating a tumbling , tumbling dickweed .
patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore , okay ? i have to go .
courtney ? dinner ?
i can't .
i'm thinking dorsia .
dorsia's nice .
nice ?
you like it there , don't you ?
the question is do you like it , courtney ? and will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight .
okay . yeah . what time ?
eight ?
pick me up ?
sounds like i'll have to . don't fall asleep , okay ? wear something fabulous . dorsia , remember ?
a facial at elizabeth arden , which was really relaxing , then to the pottery bam where i bought this silver muffin dish .
is that donald trump's car ?
oh god , patrick . shut up .
you know , courtney , you should take some more lithium . or have a diet coke . some caffeine might get you out of this slump .
i just want to have a child . just . two . perfect . children .
j b . straight .
are we here ?
yes .
this is dorsia ?
courtney , you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash . new york magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish . you'll love it . and then . the red snapper with violets and pine nuts . i think that'll follow nicely .
luis is a despicable twit .
yes , luis is a despicable twit . i hate him .
no , you idiot . i said is it a receptacle tip ? not , is luis a despicable twit . is it a receptacle tip ? get off me .
is it a what ?
pull out .
i'm ignoring you .
pull out , goddamnit !
it's a plain end . i think .
turn the light on .
oh jesus . i'm going home .
patrick . turn on the light . he turns on the light .
it's a plain end , see ? so ?
take it off .
why ?
because you have to leave half an inch at the tip to catch the force of the ejaculate ! bateman i'm getting out of here . where's your lithium ?
oh christ , this really isn't worth it . and see , courtney , it's there for what ? huh ? tell us . why is it pulled down half an inch ? so it can catch the force of the ejaculate !
well , it's not a turn on for me . i have a promotion coming to me . i don't want to get aids .
see ? happy ? you dumb bitch ? are you happy , you dumb bitch ?
will you call me before thanksgiving ?
maybe .
what are you doing tonight ?
dinner at the river cafe . au bar afterwards , maybe .
that's nice .
you and . luis ?
we were supposed to have dinner at tad and maura's , but you know how luis is .
i never knew you smoked .
listen . patrick . can we talk ?
you look marvelous . there's nothing to say . you're going to marry luis . next week , no less .
isn't that special ? patrick ?
yes , courtney ?
patrick ?
yes ?
look at this , pinkerton ! they got the payroll , and this damage will set construction back two months at least .
not to mention my men who lost their lives .
you wouldn't have done that ?
oh no , i would have done that . but i would have made sure i killed them , too .
i want them arrested and hanged !
would a jury around here convict their own ? i think not . we're beginning an interesting game here , mr . rains .
this is no game .
i'm afraid our adversaries don't agree .
a rock island and pacific railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside st . louis , missouri . the brave and daring james younger gang was heavily outnumbered by pinkerton detectives , but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the west .
it is a nice piece of writing .
the gang made off with thirty five thousand dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction , meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land ! who wrote this ! ? i'll see him hanged every tuesday for a month !
it's early in the game yet , mr . rains . jesse james and i are just learning how each other moves , feeling out each other's patterns .
i'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers !
hardly farmers . i've done some checking . all these were in the war . these men know sabotage , tactics , and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them . they are disciplined , well trained and have a charismatic leader . if i were to design the perfect outlaw band , this gang is what i would create .
so you can't tell me anything ?
it's going to be a long winter .
pinkerton . it's been eight months . i see robberies . i see hold ups . but i do not see men on the end of nooses .
first of all you , shut up . now , you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover . every time the james gang strikes , we shift a hundred detectives to that area . but there's just too much open land , too many riverbeds to ride , caves to hide in . this gang operates across four states , often riding a hundred miles between jobs .
i can't believe this .
yes , that's the way to win the locals back to our side .
i demand action .
no , you demand results . they are not the same thing . and if you want results , you will let me do my job as i see fit . unless of course , you want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it ?
can't you tell me anything ?
it's going to be a long spring .
so he's won .
every three months , the james gang circles back to the vicinity of liberty , missouri . they always pull a job right before they return , probably to have extra money to give family and friends .
in english , pinkerton .
there are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed .
can you put men at all four ?
no need . i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank .
what is that ?
why , their intense hatred of you , of course .
what the hell is that sound ?
vengeance .
mr . thaddeus rains , sir , it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field .
and it is my pleasure to be here .
really !
no ! it is not my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their pathetic little mudholes so that i may build the greatest railroad that this country has ever seen !
i can completely understand your distress , sir .
parker , tell me what's going on so i can return as quickly as possible to boston and my whores and cigars , not necessarily in that order .
two weeks ago , we managed to arrange to have the army hang one of the local farmers .
good .
unfortunately not , sir . a gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows . not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers , the redoubtable mr . alan pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident .
leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers .
yes sir .
just perfect .
a further impediment is that the army garrison has been ordered to move on from liberty . we will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers .
you see the army leaving and you see the loss of a tool . i see a power void to be filled . as we have the most power , we may move with impunity .
i see . i'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight .
i'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress .
they exchanged fire with the pinkerton guards , killing several of them . then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile .
how much did they get from the safe ?
thirty five thousand , sir . coins and currency . and the delay from the miles of destroyed track
i'll kill them for blowing up my railway !
to be precise , they didn't blow up the tracks .
then who did ? !
your men knew the risks .
with my money !
the final route for the railroad is complete .
parker .
sir ?
what is that ?
what , sir ?
that .
oh , that . i'll let jenkins explain .
this is him .
how did you know ?
not such a menace now , is he , pinkerton ?
well , this land is about to be condemned .
relax , alan . the army has this all in hand . and mr . thaddeus rains will be very pleased with this news . nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate .
my professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time .
they had to be dealt with !
by burning down their homes ?
how can that be ?
they donate money to farmers , to churches . rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of maddox so much money they were able to build a school .
there's only four of them .
move you fools !
why , yeah .
i hope you don't mind , jesse james told me your name .
oh , you were talking to jesse .
yes , but just so i could find out who you were .
really ?
i hope i'm not being too forward .
not at all .
i just though you were awful cute .
thank you , miss ?
lyla devereux .
gosh , that's a pretty name . buy you a drink ?
could we go upstairs and talk ? it's so loud down here .
why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk ?
that is so gentlemanly of you .
devereux . my brother cole dated a european girl once .
really ?
don't talk about it much , though .
and you're too young .
i'm the same age you were when you went off to war .
and the same age web was . no .
i like that .
no .
you okay , jesse ?
yeah . hey , are you drinking whisky ? you're too young to be drinking whisky .
not too young to shoot a man , not to young to drink .
i guess so .
i was always jealous web mimms got to go off and fight with you and cole . now it's my turn .
jim , you been with a girl yet ?
well , not exactly .
you been with a girl ever ?
hell yeah ! i been with . uh , not exactly . it's just , i don't want to get one of these paid ladies , you know ?
i think so .
you and frank and cole , and even bob , get all these girls because you're good looking and famous . you don't have to pay . they just look at me like i'm the baby brother . don't tell anyone , okay jesse ?
i swear .
tell you something else . i can't drink that good neither . i'm going to go outside and throw up .
what about that rock island bastard ?
. too young for whisky .
this time we'll make an exception .
jesse , you explain to lyla . my girl , you know , from that time .
you're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her , jimmy .
this is unusual . most of our marriages are members of the congregation .
you don't think god'll mind , do you ?
the lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable . jesse woodson james . jesse james ? the jesse james ?
i could have lied i suppose , but i want this marriage to be legal . i just want you to know , i'm trying to start a new life here . i'm depending on your .
discretion ? sir , i am a man of the cloth .
thank you .
now let's have a drink .
right here in church ?
communion .
we're moving you tomorrow .
but i like the presidential suite .
oh , it's a similar room . but the hotel is in washington d . c . you're not going to get a fair trial down here , in front of a jury of jesse james sympathizers .
so i'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by thaddeus rains ?
that's the idea .
did you order our houses burned down ?
not that day . i am guilty of many things , but that was mr . thaddeus rains and parker , that day .
you almost ended my career before it began .
how did you spot the ambush in torrell ?
last february ?
mmm .
you had all those cattle there , so i'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive ?
yes ?
the cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town .
damn .
almost got me in billings . i saw you there , shooting at me .
i went myself to oversee the operation . didn't help much .
no , that one was close . a couple fellas quit after that one .
oh . that's nice to know . we're going to hang you , you know .
i figured .
was it worth it ?
should have just killed thaddeus rains and been done with it .
that's what i would have done .
i'm not hanged yet .
you cocky little bastard .
ahh , you'll miss me .
no , i'll hang you . but i may miss you just a bit .
that was for my ma . now this is for everybody else .
the railroad has no business in tennessee . therefore i have no interest in the state of tennessee .
thanks .
i'd just as soon kill you , jesse james . but chasing you takes up too much of my time .
zerelda ? little zee mimms ?
you were little jesse james when you left .
but you got big !
but still died .
if there's anything we can do for you , dr . mimms . we want to help .
jesse , are you awake ?
mmmm .
jesse , is that your hand ?
nuh huh .
you shouldn't be up .
i've been on my back two weeks . i'm sick of it .
you're sick of my company ?
no ! i mean , of course not . no .
teasing you is completely unfair .
what you do to me is unfair . the teasing , i mean .
i shouldn't tease a hero .
what ?
everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued cole . we're all so proud of you , jesse . and not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since . you're everybody's hero .
i wasn't the only one risking my neck that day .
so you're saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger ?
i used to come to this tree when i was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when i got older .
you didn't want to farm ?
i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate .
a river pirate .
arr . hand over your jewels , missy .
thank god you grew out of that . you did grow out of that , didn't you ?
mostly . it would be an all right life , for a bachelor .
you planning on being a bachelor your whole life , jesse james ?
not if i find the right girl .
and what's this right girl like ?
smart . funny . bossy . always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me . and big buck teeth .
where will you find such a girl ?
ahem . from this doctrine . no , ah . from women's eyes this doctrine i derive , they sparkle still like . shiny . sparkling rocks .
sparkling rocks ?
little ones .
is this one of frank's shakespeare poems you're trying to quote ?
yep .
were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting ?
i've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time .
i am so sorry , jesse .
frank and me have to go away for a while .
you and i , we've started . something , you know ? i don't know what'll happen if you do this .
me neither .
let the law
laws don't touch men like thaddeus rains . only justice does .
whose justice ? yours or god's ? when will you stop ?
zee .
jesse . what are you thinking ? there are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county !
i had to see you . i'm getting married .
i don't understand .
she's the most wonderful woman in the world . can't get her out of my mind .
that's . wonderful . it's just . i thought .
she's beautiful . smart . and has the biggest . buck teeth in all of missouri .
i would never have imagined us in a place like this .
that's why i picked it . we can start a whole new life down here .
are you going to be happy here , mr . james ? without all that excitement ?
i've got you . you keep me busy . i figure we'll get over to the hotel . get checked in , cleaned up . then i'd like to do something i've been thinking about for a long time .
hmm .
hmm what ?
but the life of the james gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing , for these young missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies . especially the handsome and charismatic jesse james .
i beg your pardon ?
blazing guns of the west . true stories of jesse james . only a dime in the hotel lobby .
let me see that .
oh , i'm not finished . when he sauntered into a saloon , his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold , the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple . as i said . hmm .
now , sweetie , y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels , would you ?
jesse , have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble , your accent gets all farm boy ?
aw , shucks , ma'am .
stop it . this is just sad .
swimming . swimming is good .
don't turn around .
what ?
you get arrested again , i'll kill you .
yes ma'am .
i can't believe i had to blow up a train for you .
you are a hell of a woman .
don't swear .
yes ma'am .
tennessee ?
i'll explain on the way .
did you kill yankees ?
a fair number , ma .
say your prayers ?
ma , i'm glad to see you being nice to our injun friend .
he's a good christian and he killed yankees . jesus told me that made him an all right boy .
easterners .
the lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard , nobody'll ever find them .
ma ! please !
riders
we know , ma . now we got to get you to doc mimms .
take care of each other , boys . you say your prayers .
doc mimms will
shush .
y'know , uncle frank .
yeah , jimmy ?
. every time you tell that story , you stop there . that's not how it ended . i was five when my dad got shot .
allow a man his version of the past . when you get to be my age , you've got enough painful memories , you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up .
sounds like he was a hell of a man .
that he was .
they're making him a hero now .
saved a lot of folk from the railroad .
but he killed a lot of men , too .
can't argue that .
so what was he ?
i think . he was just a real interestin' fella to have around .
uncle frank ?
yeah jimmy ?
how much of that story is true ?
every time i put my head up to hit that gatling , they try to shoot it off .
distracting enough for you ?
pff . they hardly even noticed you .
so you're saying i could have done more to attract their attention .
mm hmm .
such as ?
you could have worn one of those big , floppy woman's easter sunday hats .
that would have made an impression .
i figure .
see , that's your problem , frank . by the time you finish figuring out stuff , i'm already finished doing it .
no , jesse , your problem is you're always doing stuff before i'm finished figuring it out .
web's dead .
i reckoned .
hell of a war .
hello , liberty missoura !
looks like web mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got .
we better go to doc's , see what's going on here .
frank , don't you have something to say ?
you're doing just fine .
zee , we got to talk to you and your father .
whyyyy . he took down the gatling gun and the cannon all by himself .
all we thought about was coming home . i swore i'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again . if i have to go to war with the railroad to stay , fine by me .
think about this . if we just come up with a story and stick to it , we should be all right .
that just might work .
big and older ?
you can shut up now .
you are a charmer .
i swear i'll shoot you in your sleep .
she's still talking to jesus .
if you stop saying things about my zee .
you know him ?
heard of him .
i went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed . the railroad doesn't even need our land , they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can .
damn . all that reading paid off .
you ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming ?
what do you think ?
you're looking a bit more spry now that somebody
shut up . uh , doc , i was wondering if , uh , this evening , i could come by ?
pinkertons . it's the railroad .
ma .
. we could move on . rebuild . make a decent life someplace else .
don't care .
didn't think you would . i'm going to go make the coffin .
make a thousand of 'em . still won't be enough by the time i'm through .
how'd it go in there ?
fine . how'd it go out here ?
we're gonna have to talk .
and i planned getting you off the hangman's deck
and it's guarded by pinkerton detectives .
i don't think it's counterfeit . do you mind if i take a look at all your real bills to compare ?
gents , we are in the middle of something here .
bob's upset .
pardon the delay , folks , but we had to get mad bob younger under control !
this has been a good year .
jesse , we're outlaws .
and we're good at it .
it got to you , didn't it . all the killing in the war . you need it now .
you've killed your fair share of men .
if i could go back to farming
that's a lie . you could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen .
i can't quit and leave you alone . i can't quit until you quit . ma would've wanted it that way .
we're doing this for ma .
maybe it started out that way . but now .
what do you want me to say , frank ? i was killing men when i was fifteen . i like getting shot at . i like riding out of town with a posse at my back . this is a helluva better life than farming .
we're drunk .
oh yeah .
just do me a favor . think about what this is costing everybody . not just the railroad .
you taking sides against me , now , frank ?
no , i
they're all pinned down . can't even get to the door .
got any ideas , little brother ?
shoulda learned with web . made it look fun , made it look like an adventure . got web killed . now jim .
jim was old enough .
he was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the west . how was he supposed to say no to that ?
railroad burned him out too . you couldn't have stopped him .
you're a piss poor liar for the smartest man i know .
yeah .
a war against the railroad . what the hell were we thinking ?
i'll meet you down there in a few weeks .
see you soon . oh , and i appreciate the distraction back there .
hell , they hardly even noticed us .
daddy , don't start with this again .
zerelda , it's no coincidence . the railroad men come through , offering to buy up land . nobody sells . then they start hanging men who own farms for treason ?
he's going to be fine , right daddy ?
they're gone . what are you
i fooled them into thinking i was alone .
well , i hope the boy pulls through . we should know in the morning .
he thinks this is some kind of game !
i'm upset too , zee , but jesse and cole know what they're doing . i'm sure they won't press their luck .
rode right into them , screaming like a banshee .
my little web did that ?
pff . he jumped his horse clear over our heads , killed a dozen union soldiers before they knew what hit them .
web died fighting ?
died a hero .
boys .
what do you say , sir ?
you know you're welcome any time !
yesss , but i was thinking , i could come by , and then take zee out . some place near . with other folk . near . here . but out .
it's fine by me , jesse .
what the
what is it ?
old man tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank .
so ?
where the hell were you ?
i had you covered . from back there .
shit .
i know it ain't no durned bank holiday !
you're right , sir .
then why can't i go in there ?
on account of we're robbing it .
oh . why didn't you just say so ?
it's a secret .
fine . i'll just wait here .
you 'um big lawman ?
yeah , injun . what do you want ?
great chief of st . louis send me .
of st . louis ?
ho yah . him say tell big lawman in carville that badman jesse james riding toward rising sun , above great river , near eagle rock .
east ? east above the river heading for the eagle pass ?
ho yah !
go ahead to the saloon . but don't get too drunk !
me get heap firewater
the safe . now .
of course ! uh , sir ?
what ?
where is jesse james ?
open the damn safe !
all right , all right . jesse james never yelled at folk .
cannon or gatling ?
both would be nice .
soon as i hit one , the other'll know and beat us up .
what the
i think one of 'em's glass .
which one , right or left ?
oh , lord , the dance hall girl at bunty's .
i have no idea what you just said , but it sounded real nice .
shakespeare . he's european .
bastards ! come back here and face me !
get buckets !
hey ! we decide something , that's it ! we're in this for the long haul , and this idea of me and jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep . we've got to think
strategically .
exactly . because this is a war .
jesse .
oh , you're in charge ? we ain't partners any more , jesse ? you tell cole younger where and when to ride ?
another dozen out back .
they gonna rush us ?
they're just insurance in case we run .
some indian tracker you turned out to be , tom .
you pay me to find you bluecoats . there they are .
wait'll we get back to missouri , start telling those gals about how little jesse james charged the whole union army by himself !
you ride like a comanche .
tom , why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation ? figure we might have some work for you , if you want .
hmm . go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack , or work for you .
well ?
i'm thinking .
'bout time you got here , buddy .
what's going on ?
ride with me , cousin ?
i could use the walk .
where you boys going ?
home , boys . back to our farms .
planting corn . harvesting corn . year after year .
hands off your hip , cole .
you're not scared , are you ?
not now .
what is wrong with you ?
you ever notice zerelda's eyes ?
she got two of them .
she had a moustache .
she was european !
thanks for the help .
after all you did on our farm ? you miss it , don't you jesse ?
the war ? what , are you crazy ? there are things i miss about it .
it was exciting .
but it was a whole lot of killing . why should we miss that ?
because we were good at it ? hell , we were great at it . jesse , don't tell anyone i said this , because everybody knows i'm the toughest man in this town , but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns .
this isn't a feud , this is war . they've got more men than we do . we kill detectives , they can replace 'em in a day .
so what do we do , general lee ?
just like in the war . harass their supply lines . we kill the railroad's men , they won't care .
i'll pick the first job ! i mean . i know a girl down at the bank . see if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money .
perfect , cole .
the james younger gang .
sorry .
don't let it happen again .
i got seven thousand .
i got three .
see , frank's being smart about this .
it's not a bank .
the fidelity bank and trust was robbed on tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men .
jesse , we got to have a word .
sure , cousin .
all the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the james younger gang .
yep .
this is your fault for hogging all the publicity .
hold on , hold on , we all know bob is an important part of the gang .
it'll be the biggest score yet .
smells funny , it being mentioned in the paper .
if you'd read about it first , you'd have no problems .
what are you saying ?
i've robbed just as many banks as you have ! i know this town , and i know this bank , and i say it's an easy job .
beautiful .
now the one time one of us comes up with an idea
a bad idea .
i got us through the war all right .
and almost got hanged in peacetime .
i'm the better soldier , jesse .
still smells fishy .
then let me run the show , general lee .
fine . we hit this bank .
dammit !
okay , you're gonna rest here .
bob , rip up some bandages .
pass me some whisky .
we'll make them pay for this .
i'm out .
what ? ! we follow you for a year , and now that our blood's been spilled , you're gonna quit ? !
who's next ? you ? me ? bob ?
missed you , cousin .
missed you too , cousin .
you know , you gettin' caught , right after leaving us , some people thought
where'd you get all these riders ?
we didn't . zerelda did . turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw .
what ?
you , ya barrel of pork lard . here piggy piggy !
what you sayin' boy ?
i think i recognize you .
how ?
i think i saw you leavin' by the front door just as i was coming in the back .
you shut up now , boy .
home . we go home . we ride like hell to get there , and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes . and when we get there we stay there and god help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again .
best damn plan i heard all war .
how many of them did he kill ?
two .
you have no shame .
but if we take their money and supplies .
all right , settle down . all this money ain't ours .
well , no , jesse , it was the bank's . that's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it . you explain it to him .
the outlaws calling themselves the james younger gang shot their way out of town , wounding the sherriff and three other townsfolk .
hey !
okay , folks , i think we know how this is going to go .
one false move and i'll blow your heads off !
beg pardon ?
you heard me , jesse . you know how crazy i get !
this is about the wanted ! posters , isn't it .
the things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here .
you are a fine figure of a man .
listen , jesse , we've got a problem . it's cole .
he's been full of vinegar lately .
he's planning a job .
what ?
listen , he's my brother and i don't want to start trouble .
tell me .
my plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine , thank you .
yesterday .
corn gonna shoot at me ?
nope .
then i love it .
jesus mercy , that's charlie higgins , dave laller .
cole , i want to get to the farm , make sure little jim and the girls are okay .
stop by our spread after that , tell our ma we're all right . we'll go to doc mimms .
they came up , made the same offer they made you folks . our little brother jim tried to chase 'em off , one of those detectives hit him in the head , knocked him out . cole lost his temper .
oh no .
he just lost his temper a little .
damn !
they said because the detectives were working for the department of the interior
the army can hang him .
tomorrow .
gatling ! they've got a gatling !
he's smiling .
never thought that pissant town would look so pretty .
your ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something .
here's liberty's favorite son ! i'll never forget what you did , cousin .
zee , i'm pleased you came .
our place , clell miller's , sammy johnston , the creeders . will hite .
the sheriff says it was a gang of drunk kansas boys .
these are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad .
uhh , yeah it does .
you stay out of this , bob .
no , jimmy has a point . the younger james gang could be confusing .
how ?
say we bust into a bank . we yell we're the younger james gang ! people are gonna be thinking , the younger james gang ? is there an older james gang ? how come we never heard of the older james gang ? so people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms .
we got a problem here , brother ?
frankly , yes . i'm feeling a little left out .
that's what the newspapers say . weren't for jesse james , this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick .
this is the best score yet .
it's still taking too long . the people used to snap to .
that was because of . the reputation the gang had .
as long as people think jesse's still riding , we will never get the respect we deserve .
cole , we're outlaws . not exactly the most respectable job , if you know what i mean .
how'd they
what have you done ?
i ain't done
what have you done ? !
bob . i didn't .
swear .
i swear
i'm sorry , cole .
you're just upset about jesse . we all are .
things changed when you quit the gang . for example , i'm now the one who says let's ride .
he's not bad at it .
you can ride like that ?
i think i may just go on to the reservation .
tom , i'm this close to coming with you .
i couldn't lose him .
this is healing ?
sometimes a wound will kill .
you're carrying too much money on you , hank . you better turn some in tonight .
okay , matt .
how are you fixed ?
i'm okay , matt .
that mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar .
yeah , what did he do with his first one ?
everybody in ?
i guess so .
where's charlie ?
certainly , mr . jones ! certainly ! charlie !
they're starting to come in already . yeah . yeah . well , listen . don't waste any time . get all the money you can lay your hands on , and bring it down here right away . step on it .
you turned off the burglar alarm , you set the time clock , came back at twelve and emptied the boxes , didn't you ?
wasn't anywhere near this place
sit down ! when the watchman surprised you , you shot him what'd you do with the gun ?
i didn't do it ! i haven't got a gun !
then who changed it ?
i don't know .
so you were home last night ?
yes .
what time did you get in ?
well , about uh eleven o'clock .
eleven o'clock , eh ? are you sure it was that ?
but i wasn't here , mr . dickson . honest i wasn't . . .
do you know this young man , mrs . halligan ?
for the rheumatism , you know .
what time was it , mrs . halligan ?
it was late , i know . the dooley sisters was already in . they work at a show , you know .
what time was it ?
huh ?
what time did matt brown get in ?
now , let me see a half hour after the dooley sisters and the dooley sisters never get home until after
i don't care about the dooley sisters what time did he get in ?
that's just what i'm trying to tell you , sir . it was a half hour after the dooley sisters . . .
was it twelve o'clock ?
yes , i guess it was one , 'cause .
it couldn't have been earlier ?
no . it wasn't earlier because .
yes , i know . cause the dooley sisters weren't in yet .
no because me clock struck four , and when it strikes four , it's one .
there you are !
listen here , young man nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it
what did you find out , mike ?
i've been trailing the cashier like you told me . you're right about that guy , chief . there's something screwy somewhere .
never mind all that . what did you find out ?
he left here about an hour ago and went down to dude finlay's joint .
dude finlay ?
yes , sir .
did you say dude finlay ?
yes , why ?
he was in the bank yesterday .
he was here ?
he came to see mr . cluett .
are you sure ?
yes , sir .
hello , helen !
matt , come here !
why ?
come here , honey !
hey , look out , somebody's likely to see us !
what did you do with it ?
with what ?
the ten dollars .
oh , ten dollars
yes .
a friend of mine yeah , really his mother was terribly sick and she was dying , would you believe it ?
no .
oh , you think i'm lying ?
yes .
all right , i'm lying . don't forget you called me a liar .
say , i just heard the merger isn't going thru . isn't that grand ?
yeah , swell .
what happened ? what did he say ? did you get the job ?
yeah .
what's the matter , matt ? gee , i thought you'd be thrilled to death .
come here . you know , a few minutes ago i was in cluett's office and mrs . dickson was there .
well . . . ?
well , he was making love to her .
oh matt , you must be mistaken .
i tell you , i saw them !
in cluett's office ?
yes , right in his office , the rat . i'd like to take a crack at that guy .
what's keeping you ?
oh , charlie again .
say matt , you haven't done anything about what you saw today , have you ?
who ? cluett ? no , not yet . but i'd like to take a crack at that stiff necked , horse dollar .
oh now , don't be silly .
can you imagine that guy ? he was kissing her .
now you've got me worried , dear . promise me you won't butt in .
okay , honey but just the same i'd like to take a crack at that
shh . . . ! i'll wait for you upstairs .
all right , dear .
oh , matt . . .
what's he doing , honey ? is he getting any help ?
something's happened . he isn't trying anymore .
they must have turned him down .
yes . he called some of the biggest people in town .
sure , they'd turn him down . he ought to know that . i'm going in there and talk to him .
did you talk to him ?
dickson's in a jam i tell you . the run's getting worse .
mr . williams . . .
the big guys have got the screws on him . you've got to come through for him , mr . conway . he came through for you a hundred times . if his friends don't help him , who is going to help him ?
how do you do , mrs . dickson .
is that busy husband of mine busy ?
he's at a board meeting .
board meeting . oh , that means hours , i suppose .
i'm afraid so .
helen , did you ever try competing with a bank ?
no .
well , take my word for it , and don't try it . it's useless ! if it were some other woman , i could handle her , but after all , you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now , can you ?
hardly .
oh , well . i guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite . when he comes out , you tell him i'll be back . he hasn't gotten rid of me !
all right .
yes , ma'am , you can deposit your money here .
is it safe ?
absolutely .
it's his life insurance money , you know .
quiet down , please ! take it easy , folks . everything will be all right .
but you said it would be safe ! it's his life insurance money . oh , please , i'll go to the old ladies' home if you don't do something , please !
please , lady . please be quiet . everything will be all right . open up here , folks . all right , folks , please !
well , sampson , what is it ?
here's the data on the clyde deal .
good . i'll take this along with me . tell clyde i'll see him tomorrow . i'm sick and tired of the delay .
i'm afraid he's been stalling .
that's just exactly what he has been doing . this deal should have been closed weeks ago . tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
he says he can't get away in the daytime .
how about his nights ? he's too busy running around . tell him to keep tomorrow night open , come in and sign this thing , or i'll call this whole deal off .
the lobby's half filled now .
what are you talking about ?
they've been coming in steady all morning . i have called for some extra police .
all right . send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away .
we haven't much on hand , you know . if it gets any worse , i hope we don't have to close the doors .
the bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that . this is just a flurry , that's all . they've heard about the robbery and got panic stricken . listen , get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash . wait a minute . get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too . tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot .
look at them , mr . dickson . they're going crazy .
did you get the case for the securities ?
yes , sir .
mine too ?
yes , sir . but soon as our money runs out , they'll mob the place .
the fools ! if they only knew it , they're making things worse for themselves . somebody starts a silly rumor , and they lose their heads .
what'll we do ?
i'll talk to them . listen , go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible . tell 'em not to pay any attention to what i said . tell 'em to verify every signature .
we can't keep open till four o'clock . we haven't cash enough to last an hour .
don't you think i know it ?
mr . dickson ! mr . dickson !
get all the big bills in the place . take them out and get them changed . get nothing but ones and fives . distribute them among the tellers . tell them to take their time . stall as much as possible . count and recount the money .
yes , sir .
what's the matter ? what's going on here ? this is ridiculous ! you can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion .
i'm afraid i must , mr . dickson .
why pick on him ?
it's an inside job . that's a cinch . whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout . now brown , here , is in charge of the vaults , isn't he ?
what time did this thing happen ?
the clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at .
all right . if the boy proves an alibi , he's all right , isn't he ?
if he can do it , yes .
why , certainly he can . matt , now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night , between twelve and twelve thirty , and everything will be all right .
that's what he says . i got a man from headquarters checking up on it now .
good . you've got nothing to worry about . soon as the report comes in , you'll be released . and listen , don't talk so loud . take it easy . coast a little .
all i know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed . the way i see it , brown here looks guilty .
what are you talking about ? he had no more to do with it than you did .
maybe . but i'm taking no chances . why , this kid's got a record .
so have you . so have i . so's everybody got a record . what difference does that make ? you can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they
of course it's true and he knows it .
listen , matt . if you don't tell the truth , i can't help you . where were you last night ?
you were right , mr . dickson ! brown didn't have anything to do with it . here's your man .
why , you must be crazy . i've known this man for years .
he's just confessed . he's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town .
my wife ? what's she got to do with you ?
no wonder he didn't want to mention her name .
you're lying !
don't worry , mr . dickson . we'll find out whether he's telling the truth . i'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away .
you don't want to check up on anybody . i'll do all the checking up . wait a minute .
it's all right . thanks .
what's the matter ? you don't seem very excited about it .
sure , i think it's swell .
say , come on . show a little enthusiasm . what's the matter ? are you sick or something ? go on , fake it even if it isn't real .
aw , i'm sorry , mr . dickson . it's just kind of sudden , that's all . sure , i'm excited . i think it's great . only , well , you've done so much for me already . . . i'll never be able to thank you enough .
aw , go on , forget it . you came through , didn't you ? that's all i wanted . a lot of them didn't think you would . you don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me . it's been swell . well , when are you and helen going to get married ?
well , i
i suppose you want me to fix that up for you too , eh ?
i already told him i was home .
wait a minute . wait a minute . matt , do you realize you're up against something ? you're being charged with murder . it's serious , son . now come on , i know you didn't do it . but we've got to make them believe it . come on , tell the truth , where were you last night ?
no . i won't .
you're protecting somebody .
no , i'm not mr . dickson !
yes , you are . you're protecting somebody . now listen , it doesn't make any difference who it is . it can't be as important as this . now come on , tell me . where were you last night ? come on , don't be a fool . matt , you trust me , don't you ?
we haven't got much time left , mr . dickson . we've got to do something quick or it'll be too late .
why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night ?
you're not giving up , are you , mr . dickson ?
were you in cluett's apartment ?
oh , i can explain about that later . you're losing your bank don't you realize what that means ?
was mrs . dickson there ?
listen , mr . dickson , don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down . you've got more friends than anybody in this town . little guys guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you . all you've got to do is
wait a minute . answer my question . was mrs . dickson there ?
well . . . uh . . . i . . .
she was , wasn't she ? how long has this been going on ? do you know ?
aw , i don't know what you're talking about . all i know is that you're losing your bank and
i want you both to take the day off . go downtown and get a license and get married right away !
but i haven't . . .
helen , while you're downtown , you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the berengaria sailing next week .
gee , thanks , mr . dickson
wait a minute . where's your uniform ?
i haven't any .
you haven't got a uniform ?
no , sir .
my goodness , you ought to have a uniform . how much does one cost ?
why , i don't know .
oh , make that uniform blue .
yes , sir .
well , well , well got your uniform , eh ?
yes , sir .

but , mr . dickson , i thought you were going to take care of the mortgage . i only want ten thousand . the property is worth sixty .
mr . schaffer will take good care of you . he'll give you fifteen maybe twenty . . .
yes ?
helen , i'm going to philadelphia , just as soon as the bank closes . make all the arrangements , will you ?

mr . sampson . . .
helen !

why well , i
ummm . stalling , eh ? anything new ?
why , the directors are waiting for you in the board room .
directors , eh ? long faces ?
longer .
helen , tell matt i want to see him .

if this isn't a red letter day for tom dickson ! first i trample on the board of directors , then i promote matt here to assistant cashier , and now to complete the day i have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife . what a man , what a man !
it's amazing that your sweet , lovely , gorgeous wife can ever get to see you .
what's the matter dear ? what have i done now ?
nothing . tom , i thought you were going out with me tonight .
oh , i did have a date with you tonight , didn't i ?
yes .
i'm terribly sorry . i'd forgotten all about you . i'm so sorry , dear .
now tom , you simply cannot go to philadelphia tonight . that's all there is to it .
but i have to go , dear . it's a very important banker's meeting .
i don't care whether it's important or not . you said you were going out with me , and if you hadn't promised so faithfully , i wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing .
listen , it isn't so terribly important . we can go to the theatre any time .
the theatre ?
that's what it was you planned , wasn't it ?
yes , of course .
you can take some of the girls . you can take mildred or gwynn
the girls ! i don't suppose it ever occurred to you that i might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
ho ! ho ! ho !
ho , ho , ho , yourself ! i wouldn't laugh if i were you . you may not suspect it , but i'm still attractive to some .
listen , don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
well . . .
don't you forget that i'm still the head man around here too . now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night . you and i are going out together . how's that ?
all right . i'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night .
happy now ?
no .
listen , dear . i want to ask you something . i know it's a silly thing for me to ask you , but . . . i want you to tell me the truth . where were you last night ?
last night ? er why uh , last night . . .
listen , dear . now tell me the truth about this . were you in cluett's apartment ?
in cluett's apartment ? well dear , you see , i . . . i . . .
good morning , mr . dickson .
john , how's your wife this morning ?
much better this morning , thank you .
got a handkerchief ?
excuse me
wait a minute . how do you feel this morning ?
i'm feeling fine this morning .
that makes it unanimous . i feel all right too .
shall we let the people come in ?
of course , let them in ! you're late now .
good morning , mr . dickson . my wife is much better this morning .
well , that's too bad . mine's all right too .
are the payrolls ready for tomorrow ?
yes , sir .
let me see your cash book , will you ?
now ?
yes , now .
the butler said i could stay . i told him it was important .
oh , yeah ?
well , i thought i'd like to have a little talk with you .
i'm listening .
it's funny now that i'm here , i don't know just how to go about it . you see , i kind of expected to find you here alone .
anything you have to say to me , you can say in the morning .
oh no , mr . cluett , if it's all the same to you , i'd rather not wait . it's about you and mrs . dickson .
i'm not interested in what you think .
you've no right to do this to her , mr . cluett . why don't you think it over ? it's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble .
i tell you , i'm not interested in your opinion .
no ? then maybe you'll understand , mrs . dickson . oh , gee , he's crazy about you . nobody knows it better than you . if he ever finds out , it'll kill him .
phyllis , you don't have to explain anything . you'd do well to mind your own business .
this is my business . mr . dickson's been like a father to me . what has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this ?
that will be just about enough ! now get out of here !
i guess i have said enough i'm just wasting my breath talking to you .
this won't do . not during business hours . . .
why , i needed a
what is the matter with you ? you're trembling ?
am i ? why , i i don't know any reason why i should be , unless of course it's you . . .
me ?
being alone with you has always done this to me . you know that .
for a celebrated bounder , that is an awful admission . besides , i never knew that any female could do this to you .
well , you can . you always could .
here , here , here , now ! don't you go back to work on me , too . i'm getting tired of this . besides , it's beginning to affect your looks
what is ?
running around . not your work . you'd better start reforming , cyril !
if i thought you were the slightest bit interested , i would .
not bad , not bad at all . do you know something ? i've always been curious about your line .
line ?
come on cyril , try a little bit of it out on me . i haven't had any first class blarney thrown at me since the day i was married .
but you see , it isn't blarney where you're concerned .
doesn't that come next ?
yes , yes , it does . what are you doing tonight , phyllis ?
oh ! oh , no ! i think i've done enough experimenting for one day . congratulations , cyril . you've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order . i shall recommend you highly .
please , please don't laugh at me , phyllis . i must see you tonight !
but i'm giving a party for him a real , old fashioned surprise party . caps , bells , whistles , and everything . i'm really terribly excited about it . i've been planning it for months .
well
well , what ?
well , aren't you going to invite me ?
you ? no can do . it's all set . just a few of tom's closest friends .
now phyllis , if you don't invite me , i'm coming anyway .
don't be silly , cyril . these are respectable people . they'd probably bore you to death .
no , they won't . not when you are there . oh , please , be a sport . please ask me .
why are you so anxious ?
don't you know ?
no .
i want to be near you !
what ?
don't you know i've been crazy about you for years ?
now wait a minute , wait a minute .
i've loved you ever since i can remember , long before you married tom dickson .
why , cyril , you're insane
no . no , i'm not . i deliberately avoided you . i was afraid of making a fool of myself . but i won't stand it any longer
what's this ?
my apartment .
i knew i couldn't trust you . you told me you were taking me home .
come on up for just a few minutes . we'll have just one drink , then we'll go .
no . i know the answer to that one . i think you'd better take me home .
what's the matter ? afraid papa will spank ?
no . no , i'm afraid papa isn't that much interested . he's too busy rushing off to philadelphia to make stuffy , old speeches at stuffy , old bankers' meetings . too busy closing big , important deals i think i will have a drink .
good for you . come on .
you know , there ought to be a congressional medal for men like you . america's comfort to misunderstood wives . i never thought i would find myself in that class .
oh , you're not so badly off . there's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife .
what is that , mr . bones ?
and now fair woman , i have you in my power .
i'm not afraid of you . you haven't got a moustache !
i'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here .
why , matt !
what are you doing here ?
you know what we do to welchers , cluett , don't you ?
i know , i know , dude . oh , i must have been crazy ! i lost my head completely !
that's your funeral . we've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us .
i haven't got it .
then what did you want to gamble for ? if you'd have beat us out of fifty g's , you'd have been paid , wouldn't you ? well , we want our dough .
i'm sorry , dude , buti
that don't do us any good .
but after all , you can't take blood from a stone .
we can take blood from anything if it's comin' to us .
good heavens , man ! you're not suggesting that i
why not ?
why , i couldn't do that . . . !
you don't have to do nothing .
what do you mean ?
all you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest , see ?
dude there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this , is there ?
you ? no , you'll be all right , so long as you establish an alibi for tonight .
know , but
be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked . understand ?
but dude , listen couldn't we make this some other time ?
listen , buddy , you're getting by pretty easy . quit squawking !
confessed ! cluett , in heaven's name , what got into you ?
i don't know . it's all been like a crazy nightmare , mr . dickson .
what happened ? you're not a thief . how'd you get mixed up with these kind of people ?
gambling i owed them a lot of money . last week i lost over fifty thousand dollars !
fifty thousand dollars !
but i didn't kill that man last night . honest i didn't , mr . dickson !
what was my wife doing in your apartment last night ?
nothing , nothing , mr . dickson . don't pay any attention to me . i don't know what i'm saying .
you just mentioned her name . what was she doing there ? what was she doing in your apartment ?
she wasn't to blame , mr . dickson . it wasn't her fault . honest , it wasn't . i begged her to come up . she didn't
get out , get out !
i hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions , mr . cluett .
of course , yes . just what would you like to know , inspector ?
where were you at twelve o'clock last night ?
that's very simple . i was home .
that is simple , isn't it ? i assume you can prove that if necessary .
oh yes , of course . there was someone with me . a lady .
looks like you're going to have no trouble at all . what was the lady's name , mr . cluett ?
if you don't mind , inspector , i'd rather not say that is , unless it becomes absolutely essential . you see , she's married .
oh !
you understand ?
thanks .
somebody must be in good humor . he was humming mother machree .
it's one of the boys from headquarters . he always sings mother machree whenever he's got good news . looks like this case'll be settled in no time .
stand back inspector , or i'll shoot . drop that gun .
don't be a fool , cluett . this is only going to make it worse for you .
stand back , inspector . let me out of here , or i'll shoot you !
what were you doing at finlay's this morning ?
i was crazy , i tell you , mr . dickson . i didn't know what i was doing . i wandered around in a daze . all i could think of was that they were going to kill me . . . you'll stand by me , won't you , mr . dickson ? you won't go back on me now , will you ? i'll die if they send me to prison !
don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs .
i didn't kill him ! i had nothing to do with that , i tell you ! i was home in my apartment last night i can prove it !
claims he was there with a married woman . doesn't want to mention her name .
he won't believe it , mr . dickson . but it's the truth honest it is . i was in my apartment last night ask your wife she
say , you know , i found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball . you've got to hit with the left hand , and from the inside out , it's the only way you can hit anything
i think , mr . dickson , we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning , if you don't mind .
what's the matter with my policy ? how many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty five years ? i'll tell you . not a single one ! what's wrong with that kind of banking ?
character , hmmpf ! that's your idea ?
most of the creditors i know personally . i've seen them grow up in the community . i knew their fathers and mothers before them .
i know , dickson . that's all very well . but you're taking too many chances . in these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble . in case of emergency !
i'm running this bank my way . get that clear !
gentlemen , you notice mr . dickson refuses to consider our wishes . he refuses an offer to merge with the new york trust the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground . he insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith !
yes ! you said it , clark . that's the only thing that means anything to me .
we want to talk to you .
what about ?
we'll discuss that in the board room .
we'll be forced to shut the doors . i've worked twenty five years night and day to keep this bank alive . you've all made money out of it . are you willing to help ?
what do you mean , help ?
i know that among you , you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city . get that money over here and i'll stop this run within five minutes .
that sounds very simple , dickson , but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes ?
i have everything i own in it . it's your bank as well as mine , isn't it ?
the depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you . you thought they were your friends . why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them ?
aw , they've gone crazy . you can't reason with a mob .
no . you can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam . we pleaded with you to keep liquid , but you wouldn't listen to us . you preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish . now you want our help . you want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked . all right . there's one way you can get it . give us an option on your stock and resign as president .
so , that's it , eh ? you've waited a long time for this chance , haven't you ? well , i'm not going to resign now or ever .
say , you can't do that
i can't ? you just wait and see . if that run doesn't stop within the next hour , i'll shut the doors . you know what that means ? the bank examiner will step in tomorrow . you'll be forced to liquidate . i'll insist upon it . the depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar . what's left you gentlemen can have . but i'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill .
dickson , i'd like to talk to you about the bank .
come out here you pawnbrokers take a look at this !
we've been waiting fifteen minutes
you know what you can do with that ! come on , take a look at this ! you'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world .
personally , i think you're getting panic stricken about nothing . dickson's all right .
oh , is he ? we carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city . we're fools to tolerate it .
don't make me laugh , schultz !
dickson doesn't have to go . but he must agree to this merger with new york trust
what good will that do ?
how are you protecting your depositors ? by making a lot of idiotic loans !
you know dickson as well as we do . he'll shut the doors before he gives up control .
mr . dickson in yet ?
not yet , mr . clark .
when he comes in , tell him we're waiting for him in the board room .
yes , sir .
and tell him not to delay .
yes , sir .
say matt , i'll have to have some money for those manville payrolls .
how much ?
about twenty four thousand .
it was more than that last week .
yeah .
say , do me a favor , will you charlie ?
yeah .
let me have ten bucks ?
ten bucks ? say , if i had ten bucks , i'd quit .
charlie !
yeah ?
i'll pay it back to you saturday on the level i will . give a guy a break , will you ? i've got to get it back in my account . if helen ever finds out that i
whose death ?
it'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks .
say pal , did you ever hear of a depression ?
where you been ?
where do you think i've been ? i took the baby for a stroll in the park .
what's the matter , charlie ?
i'm fourteen cents out , and it took me half an hour to find the mistake . and me with a date , too .
i remember once when your account checked .
yeah .
and listen , wise guy i'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock , so no squawks out of you guys in the morning .
oscar , what's the matter ?
i was the first one to see it . i was coming down the stairs , and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet .
no kidding ?
no kidding . when i saw it , you could'a knocked me over with a pin .
where's matt ?
matt ?
yeah . he'll have a tough time thinking up a wise crack for this one . . .
the detectives got matt up there in sampson's office .
he has ?
yeah .
hello , tom .
you here again ? what do you want ?
what do you suppose anybody wants ? money , money , money !
listen , i told you i wasn't interested in that deal , didn't i ?
tom , i never had trouble getting credit from you before . when i was flat broke you gave me all the money i wanted . now i come to you with a swell deal , and the greatest
i'll tell you why . i don't like the crowd you're mixed up with . personally , you can have all the credit you want . but for that deal not a cent .
what's the idea of turning her down ? it sounds like a perfectly safe investment .
she's a widow . i don't like taking mortgages from widows .
why not ?
if she can't pay , i'll have to foreclose , won't i ?
yes sure
no , thank you .
sorry .
has mr . kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors ?
he may have a point , lieutenant . two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man .
sgt . mcmanus , are you suggesting that david and jack were , in fact , attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of east proctor has conspired to keep it a secret ? we have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police . we have two witnesses to the crime . you'll forgive me , mr . kessler , if i consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock .
lieutenant , the boy seems pretty lucid to me and .
and what , sergeant ?
i don't rightly know , sir .
i cannot accept a connection between david kessler and last night's murders . we will find him , however . i can assure you of that .
we'll find him , not to worry .
do you have any hot soup ?
no .
hot chocolate ?
we've got spirits and beer . if it's something hot you want , you can have tea .
then you have some hot tea ?
no .
oh .
but i can heat some up for you if you'd like .
remember the alamo ?
hello , there . what can i get you ?
campari and soda would do nicely .
sorry , love .
what's that ?
oh , that's been there for two hundred years . we were going to paint it out , but it's traditional , so we left it .
yes ?
lt . villiers and sgt . mcmanus are here to see you , doctor .
excuse me . yes ?
roger mathison , doctor .
what here ?
he's on the telephone .
tell him i'm out . no , tell him i've passed away . an old war wound or something . tell him i'm dead . and no more calls !
dr . hirsch ?
come in , come in . please sit . some tea ?
no , thank you , doctor .
you were saying ?
has david kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors ?
why don't we ask him ?
the forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved , that's true , but i hardly think .
what can we do to assist you ?
stay here . if we need you , we'll know where to reach you .
are you cold ?
yes .
good .
jack .
david .
you're not having a good time are you ?
oh , i don't know . i mean look around . isn't this a fun place ?
well , i like it here .
i'm sorry . northern england first , italy later .
right .
do you think she'll meet me in rome ?
i think debbie klein is a mediocre person with a good body .
debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time .
she's a jerk .
you're talking about the woman i love .
i'm talking about a girl you want to fuck , so give me a break .
well , anyway , do you think she'll be there ?
i don't know .
rendezvous in rome starring jack goodman and debbie klein . the love affair that shocked europe ! see torrid lovemaking at its most explicit ! see jack and debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the vatican ! never has the screen dared .
if you don't stop , i'm going to kill you .
i have to make love to her . it's very simple . she has no choice really .
it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull .
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull .
we've known debbie what , since the eighth grade ? how many years of foreplay is that ?
the slaughtered lamb ?
of course , the slaughtered lamb . why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol ?
that's a wolf's head .
of course , the slaughtered lamb . why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol ?
that's not a spear . it's a pike .
a severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol .
david , before we go in there i want you to know that no matter what happens to us it's your fault .
i assume full responsibility .
okay .
hello .
nice looking group .
listen , at least it's warm in here .
look at that .
what about it ?
it's a five pointed star .
maybe the owners are from texas .
ask them what the candles are for .
you ask them .
listen , that's a pentangle , a five pointed star . it's used in witchcraft . lon chaney , jr . and universal studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man .
i see . you want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters .
right .
wrong .
go on , ask them .
jack , we'd better go .
what do you mean ? i'm starving .
come on , jack , shall we go ? !
what the hell was that all about ?
i don't know . let's see if there's an inn or something up the road .
beware the moon ?
that was weird . i guess leaving was the best idea .
i don't know . now that we're out here and it's three degrees , i'm not so sure i wouldn't rather face a blood thirsty mob .
well , not quite a blood thirsty mob .
what do you think was wrong ?
i have no idea .
maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural .
i see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it , because they felt so silly .
say , david .
i'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in rome at the present time thank you .
did you hear that ?
i heard that .
what was it ?
could be a lot of things .
yeah ?
a coyote .
there aren't any coyotes in england .
the hound of the baskervilles .
pecos bill .
heathcliffe .
heathcliffe didn't howl .
no , but he was on the moors .
i vote we go back to the slaughtered lamb .
yeah .
shit ! david , what is that ?
i don't know . come on .
come on , where ?
it's moving .
it's circling us .
what's the plan ?
plan ?
it's in front of us .
oh shit . what is that ?
a sheep dog or something . turn slowly and let's walk away .
nice doggie . good boy .
walk away , jack .
walking away , yes , sir . here we are walking away .
see anything ?
no .
it sounds far away .
not far enough . come on .
jack ?
yeah .
where are we going ?
i'll tell you when we get there .
well . i'm glad we . whoaa !
you really scared me , you shithead .
are you going to help me up ?
nice to see you .
get the fuck out of here , jack .
thanks a lot .
this is too much . i can't handle this .
david ! you're hurting my feelings .
hurting your feelings ? has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me ? listen to me , i'm talking to a hamburger !
i'm sorry to be upsetting you , david , but i had to come .
aren't you supposed to be buried in new york someplace ?
yeah . your parents came to my funeral . i was surprised at how many people came .
why should you be surprised ? you were a very well liked person .
debbie klein cried a lot .
i can't stand it .
so you know what she does ? she's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in rudy levine's bed .
rudy levine the shmuck ?
life mocks me even in death .
i'm going completely crazy .
david !
what ? !
david , now i know this may be hard for you , but i have to warn you .
warn me ? will you get out of here , you meat loaf ?
i'm a grisly sight , it's true but i love you and that's why i'm here . you've got to know .
if you love me so much , jack , you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead !
we were attacked by a werewolf .
i'm not listening !
on the moors , we were attacked by a lycanthrope , a werewolf .
shut up , you zombie !
i was murdered , an unnatural death , and now i walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted .
what's wrong with you ? shut up !
the wolf's bloodline must be severed . the last remaining werewolf must be destroyed .
will you be quiet ? !
it's you , david .
what ? !
you survived and now you shall continue the curse .
what are you talking about ? i won't accept this ! get out ! god damit !
remember what that guy at the slaughtered lamb said ? 'beware the moon . '
stop it , jack .
beware the moon . the full moon , david . you've got two days .
jack , please go away . please go away .
you'll stalk the streets of london a creature of the night .
you're talking like boris karloff ! it's movie dialogue !
david , please believe me . you will kill people , david . you've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins .
nurse !
listen to me ! take your own life , david . it's our only chance .
nurse !
the supernatural ! the powers of darkness ! it's all true . take your own life ! suicide , david . join me .
nurse ! oh god ! alex !
it's cold , david , and i'm so alone . the undead surround me . have you ever talked to a corpse ? it's boring ! i'm lonely ! kill yourself , david , before you kill others .
you're not real .
don't be an asshole , david . come here .
what are you doing here ?
i wanted to see you .
okay , you've seen me . now go away .
david , i'm sorry i upset you yesterday , but you must understand what is going on .
i understand all right . you're one of the undead and i'm a werewolf .
yes .
get out of here , jack !
david , tomorrow night is the full moon . you'll change , you'll become .
a monster . i know , i know .
you must take your own life now , david , before it's too late .
jack , are you really dead ?
what do you think ?
i think i've lost my mind . i think you're not real . i think i'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream .
you must believe me .
what , jack ? that tomorrow night beneath the full moon i'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people ? bullshit !
the canines will be real . you'll taste real blood ! god damit , david , please believe me ! you'll kill and make others like me ! i'm not having a nice time , david ! don't allow this to happen again ! you must take your own life !
hi , jack .
hi , david .
what can i say , jack ?
you don't have to say anything .
aren't you going to say , 'i told you so' ?
if i was still alive , i probably would .
you look awful .
thank you .
i didn't mean it . i don't know what i'm saying . i'm not even sure it was me who killed those people . i don't remember doing it .
what about the zoo ?
well , even if i'm not the wolfman , i am crazy enough to do something like that . i mean , here i sit in leicester square talking to a corpse . i'm glad to see you , jack .
david kessler , this is gerald bringsly .
hello .
because this must be stopped .
i could hang myself .
if you did it wrong , it would be painful . you'd choke to death .
hello , david . i am dr . hirsch and this is a countryman of yours , mr . collins .
where am i ?
you're in a hospital in london .
london ? where's jack ? i had a strange dream .
i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences .
the guy i was with . is he all right ? how did i get to london ?
miss price ! miss price , please !
how long have i been here ?
you've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago .
two weeks ?
you've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises , lost a bit of blood , but nothing too serious black and blue for a while . you'll have some dueling scars to boast of . that lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow . they say a mad man has the strength of ten .
lunatic ?
now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative , so try to get some rest now . miss price will see to your needs . rest now .
there were witnesses ?
so they said .
how could there have been witnesses ? it was so dark . we were running and i fell and jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere . i don't understand what they're talking about .
in time i'm sure it will all come back to you .
doctor , my memory is fine . it's my sanity i'm beginning to worry about .
you've never had bad dreams before ?
sure , as a kid . but never so real . never so bizarre .
did you get a good look at the man who attacked you ?
i've told you , it wasn't a man . it was an animal . a big wolf or something . a rabid dog .
yes .
look , dr . hirsch , i know i've been traumatized , but jack was torn apart . i saw him . a man can't do that to someone with his bare hands .
you'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of .
did you see jack ?
no . in fact , your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here .
did you talk to the police in east proctor ? did the cops go to the slaughtered lamb ?
i really don't know .
then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me ? you yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that .
david , please . the police are satisfied . i'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern england we'd have seen it on the telly .
you really think i'm crazy , don't you ?
believe me . the hound of the baskervilles was an invention of sir arthur conan doyle's . and if you'd read the bloody book , you'd find that holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud , a fake .
dr . hirsch ? i'd rather not be by myself .
of course not , david . i'll fetch in young miss price .
mr . kessler ? wake up , please .
i was having a nightmare .
now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for dr . hirsch in the morning .
what time is it ?
it's nearly eight . i'm off duty shortly , then i'm off to the films with alex .
alex ?
miss price , the other nurse that attended you .
what are you going to see ?
an american film about the mafia called 'see you next wednesday' , and i want to see it badly , so you give me no problems and go to sleep .
do you have bad dreams , too ?
some , everyone does .
yes , but does everyone kill bambi ?
bambi ?
here , gladys , tom . did you hear the one about the crashing plane ?
no , but we're about to .
you be quiet , woman , and let me speak .
quiet , everyone ! hush ! shhh !
all right , laugh then . i shan't tell it .
oh , come on , tell us .
oh , all right . there was this airplane over the atlantic on its way to new york . it was full of men from the united nations .
that's very funny , that is .
no one brought them here ! no one wanted them here !
you could have told them !
why are you doing this to me , jack ?
this isn't mr . goodman's idea . he is your good friend , whereas i am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities .
mr . bringsly , i'm sorry . i have absolutely no idea what to say to you .
you've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless . and i understand that i am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted .
that's easy for you to say you're already dead .
no , david . harry and i and everyone you murder are not dead . the undead .
officer , i killed those people last night .
all right , you two , move along .
hey , you asshole ! i want you to arrest me !
there's no call for that kind of language .
queen elizabeth is a man ! prince charles is a faggot ! winston churchill was full of shit !
now see here young man .
who is this girl ?
you're going to have to stop this disturbance or i shall arrest you .
that's what i want you to do , you moron !
miss price .
yes , mrs . hobbs .
take these round now , will you please ? the american boy in twenty one is only to have these after he's eaten . will you be sure of that ?
has he been refusing food ?
nothing quite as dramatic as that , miss price . he just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him . he suffers from nightmares . i'd think he just needs a hand to hold .
yes , mrs . hobbs .
he all right ?
yes , i should think . he called out just now .
he's an american , you know . dr . hirsch is going to fetch round one of those embassy fellows to see him .
chart says he's from new york .
i think he's a jew .
why on earth do you say that ?
i looked .
hello , benjamin .
no .
no what ?
no .
well , all right then , be that way . here , swallow this .
no .
feeling better ?
no .
the doctor will be round later . would you like a picture book to look at ? we have some lovely funny beanos .
no .
how are we feeling tonight ?
no .
no what ?
no !
benjamin , have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck ?
no .
i thought not .
it wasn't a lunatic .
i beg your pardon ?
it was a wolf .
what ?
a wolf .
mr . kessler ?
yes ?
you haven't eaten your lunch .
i'm not very hungry , thank you .
i'm afraid you have to eat something .
please , really . i'm not hungry .
you put me in an awkward position , mr . kessler .
how is that ?
well , you're to take these after you've eaten . now what kind of nurse would i be if i failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills ?
leave the pills . i'll take them later .
sorry .
aw come on , miss price !
call me alex .
aw come on , alex !
shall i be forced to feed you , mr . kessler ?
call me david .
shall i be forced to feed you , david ?
this is absurd . i'm not hungry . i don't want any food .
let's try a little harder , shall we ?
you're a very beautiful girl .
i thought you were asleep .
i was . what are you reading ?
'a connecticut yankee in king arthur's court' by mark twain .
do you like it ?
what do you dream about ?
i dream of death mostly .
i'm sorry . i shouldn't have asked you .
how old are you ?
that's not really a very proper question .
how old are you ?
twenty eight .
i'm twenty seven .
i know .
now what do you want to talk about ?
was jack goodman your good friend ?
my best friend . my very best friend .
shall i read to you ?
what ? oh , yes , please .
a connecticut yankee in king arthur's court by samuel l . clemens . this is after the preface but before chapter one a word of explanation . you all right ?
yes , go on .
hello . you all right ?
i'm sorry i woke you up .
don't be silly . can i get you something ?
no , thank you . just keep me company for a while .
that's easy enough .
i keep having these really terrible dreams . they are getting worse and i can't seem to stop them .
david , your dreams will stop . you'll leave england and your bad memories and then this will all fade away .
will you come with me ?
what ?
i'm serious . you don't know me and i know nothing about you . we have a perfect relationship .
now , david , i said i would keep you company , but i meant right here and now .
will you think about it ?
how did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient ?
not just a patient me .
you're being awfully forward , aren't you ?
forgive me , i'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it .
all i am to you is a sex fantasy then ?
now i'm embarrassed .
good . i thought for a moment i was the only embarrassed one in the room .
i'm a werewolf .
are you better now ?
i'll let you know the next full moon .
you're to be discharged tomorrow . will you be all right ?
my friend jack was just here .
your dead friend jack ?
yeah . he says that i will become a monster in two days . what do you think ?
what do i think ? you mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends ?
i was dreaming again ?
i would think so .
yeah , i would think so , too .
the kitchen .
very nice .
closet .
charming .
bathroom .
lovely .
the bedroom .
there is only one bed .
david , perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while i take a shower .
it's nice to see you .
it's nice to see you .
alex ?
yes ?
will you be here in about fifteen minutes ?
of course .
good .
david , you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you ? do you really ?
i was awake and he was in my room .
but , david .
i wasn't hallucinating .
tomorrow is the full moon .
that's good , alex . reassure me .
let me go now , you'll make me late .
do me an enormous favor ?
anything .
tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive .
it's silly of you to be apprehensive .
werewolves simply do not exist .
david , do you want me to stay here tonight ?
yeah , i do , but go to work .
listen , if you get too anxious , call me at the hospital , okay ?
okay .
i've left those pills for you .
a doper werewolf .
i'm off . there's food in the fridge .
see you later .
david ! where on earth have you been ! ? !
alex , i've lost my mind . i woke up at the zoo ! but you know what ? i feel terrific !
the zoo ?
waking up at the zoo , that's not so insane . having no clothes on ? that's insane . what did i do last night , alex ?
don't you remember ?
i said goodbye to you . i was locked out of the flat . i climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window . i started to read and then i was naked at the zoo ! i guess i am out of my fucking mind .
the next corner we can get a cab .
i should be committed .
dr . hirsch will know what to do .
i don't know why i feel so good . i haven't felt this good in a long time .
but .
pull over .
david , what are you doing ?
six people mutilated ? it had to be me , alex .
david , stop !
i am going to the cops . there's a full moon tonight . jack was right . i .
jack is dead !
jack is dead . look , six people have been killed . i'm going to the police .
david , please be rational . let's go to dr . hirsch .
rational ! ? ! i'm a fucking werewolf , for christ's sake !
he's playing a stupid joke , sir .
what ?
we had an argument . he's being silly .
i swear , i don't know this girl .
sir , he's very upset . his friend was killed and .
hopeless . it's hopeless .
david , let's go now .
leave me alone , dammit ! you people are crazy ! i've got to get away from here ! i've got to do something !
david , don't lose control .
control ! ? ! what control ! ? ! get away from me !
dr . hirsch , mr . kessler cried out a minute ago .
can i be of service , miss price ?
dr . hirsch ?
go about your duties .
yes , doctor .
oh , miss price ?
yes , doctor ?
what exactly did he call out ?
he said 'jack' .
that would be jack goodman , the boy who was killed .
what happened to them ?
the police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them . he must have been a very powerful man . although i really don't see that it is any of your concern , miss price .
no , sir . of course , sir . good day , doctor .
did he say a wolf ?
it's all right , susan . yes , doctor , i have .
oh dear girl , your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me . i don't give a damn who you sleep with . i'm concerned about david .
yes , sir .
it's a full moon . where is he ?
he's not ?
alex , has david persisted in his werewolf fantasies ?
well , yes , but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend .
has his friend appeared to him again ?
yes .
what did he say ?
david says jack comes to warn him .
warn him ?
dr . hirsch , what's wrong ? is this more serious than i know ?
i tried to investigate the attack . there are no records . the case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file . david's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before i did . the goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us . so i went to the pub in east proctor where i was convinced of two things .
yes .
they were lying . there were no witnesses , no escaped lunatic . the whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there .
and what else ?
you've absolutely no idea where david might be ?
surely you're not suggesting .
david has suffered a severe trauma . i myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in east proctor . if all the villagers believe that jack goodman was killed by a werewolf , why shouldn't david ? and then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf , wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon ?
dr . hirsch ?
oh , i don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon . but in such a deranged state he could harm himself , or perhaps others .
what shall we do ?
let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy .
he's here .
is he all right ? why didn't you call me ? where was he ?
he doesn't remember . he woke up at the zoo .
the zoo ? is he rational ?
yes , he is . he's very excited and confused , but he's not crazy , if that's what you mean .
have you read the papers today ? have you listened to the radio or television ?
no , why ?
is david acting strangely ?
no , not really .
could you get here without any trouble ?
yes , i should think so .
right . now listen carefully . i want you to bring david here . i want him in my care . i'll notify the police that we've found him . it is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital . do you understand ?
yes , doctor .
you're certain he's lucid ? you won't need any help ?
he's fine . we'll come right over .
shall i send a car ?
no , a cab will be faster .
i expect you shortly .
what shall we do ?
nurse hobbs said there's a disturbance in leicester square involving some sort of mad dog .
david ?
i doubt it . but it's something to do .
has the patient in twenty one gotten his tray yet ?
the american ? yes , duck .
how did he look ?
what do you mean , 'how did he look' ?
you know , did he seem depressed ? do you think he'll eat the food ?
i'm an orderly , not a bleeding psychiatrist ! i push things about , but i've little say what happens to them .
herr salieri .
yes , i am looking after him .
can we come in ?
well , he's sleeping now . better not .
but he's all right ?
oh , yes . he's just exhausted . he became dizzy , that's all . we should let him rest .
well , tell him we were here , won't you ?
of course .
and say everything went wonderfully . a triumph de luxe say that ! tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times .
bene .
i'll call tomorrow .
yes . and congratulations to all of you . it was superb .
oh , by the way , give him this . this is his share . that should cheer him up , eh ?
yes , indeed . goodnight to you all now . it was perfection truly !
excuse me , sir , there is a lady who insists on talking to you .
who is she ?
she didn't say . but she says it's urgent .
excuse me , my dear .
that lady is back , sir .
what does he want ?
he didn't say , sir . i told him i didn't know when you would be back , but he insisted on waiting .
come with me . and stay in the room .
this is embarrassing , you know . you introduced mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them . it has to stop .
i agree , baron .
can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him ? i've done my best . i got him to arrange some bach for my sunday concerts . he got a fee what i could afford . can't you think of anyone who might do something for him ?
no , baron , no . i'm afraid mozart is a lost cause . he has managed to alienate practically the whole of vienna . he is constantly drunk . he never pays his debts . i can't think of one person to whom i dare recommend him .
how sad . it's tragic , isn't it ? such a talent .
indeed . just a moment as a matter of fact i think i do know someone who could commission a work from him . a very appropriate person to do so . yes .
here i am , my angel .
what ? who the devil are you ?
i've taken pity on you , my angel . i heard your wish .
oh . well , thank you ! how wonderful . some people get all the luck .
now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever . then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you .
i can't wait .
well , promise then .
what do you mean now ?
of course now . right away , before i get any older .
well , i don't know ! i mean you're a delicious , delightful , delectable little bird , but don't you think you might be just a little tough ?
oh , i'm tender enough for you , my boy . i'm tender enough for you .
bravo , your majesty !
well done , sire !
well , actually , sire , if you remember , we did finally incline to italian .
i know we banned this play , but frankly i can't remember why . can you refresh my memory , herr director ?
for the same reason , herr chamberlain , that it was banned in france .
oh yes , yes . and that was ?
well , the play makes a hero out of a valet . he outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher . do you see the implications ? this would be , in a grander situation , as if a chamberlain were to expose an emperor .
ah .
i've just learned something that might be of interest to you , herr director .
yes ?
mozart is writing a new opera . an italian opera .
you mean that play ?
exactly .
he's setting that play to music ?
yes .
are you absolutely sure ?
i've seen the manuscript .
where ?
never mind .
well , mozart is already rehearsing .
incredible .
what anger ?
about the ballet .
ballet ? what ballet ?
excuse me didn't his majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera ?
yes , absolutely . is there a ballet in figaro ?
yes , in the third act .
what do you want ?
i am father vogler . i am a chaplain here . i thought you might like to talk to someone .
about what ?
you tried to take your life . you do remember that , don't you ?
so ?
in the sight of god that is a sin .
what do you want ?
do you understand that you have sinned ? gravely .
leave me alone .
i cannot leave alone a soul in pain .
do you know who i am ? you never heard of me , did you ?
that makes no difference . all men are equal in god's eyes .
are they ?
offer me your confession . i can offer you god's forgiveness .
i do not seek forgiveness .
my son , there is something dreadful on your soul . unburden it to me . i'm here only for you . please talk to me .
how well are you trained in music ?
i know a little . i studied it in my youth .
where ?
here in vienna .
then you must know this .
i can't say i do . what is it ?
well ?
i regret it is not too familiar .
can you recall no melody of mine ? i was the most famous composer in europe when you were still a boy . i wrote forty operas alone . what about this little thing ?
oh , i know that ! that's charming ! i didn't know you wrote that .
i didn't . that was mozart . wolfgang amadeus mozart . you know who that is ?
of course . the man you accuse yourself of killing .
ah you've heard that ?
all vienna has heard that .
and do they believe it ?
is it true ?
do you believe it ?
do you hear me ?
it was incomprehensible . what was god up to ? here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve god's gift and there was mozart indulging his in all directions even though engaged to be married ! and no rebuke at all ! was it possible i was being tested ? was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense , no matter how painful ? that was very possible . all the same , why him ? why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility ? my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man . for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts . i couldn't stop them .
did you try ?
yes , father . yes ! so much for my vow of chastity . what did it matter ? good , patient , hard working , chaste what did it matter ? had goodness made me a good composer ? i realized it absolutely then that moment goodness is nothing in the furnace of art . and i was nothing to god .
you cannot say that !
no ? was mozart a good man ?
god's ways are not yours . and you are not here to question him . offer him the salt of penitence . he will give you back the bread of eternal life . he is all merciful . that is all you need to know .
all i ever wanted was to sing to him . that's his doing , isn't it ? he gave me that longing then made me mute . why ? tell me that . if he didn't want me to serve him with music , why implant the desire , like a lust in my body , then deny me the talent ? go on , tell me ! speak for him !
my son , no one can speak for god .
oh ? i thought you did so every day . so speak now . answer me !
i do not claim to unravel the mysteries . i treasure them . as you should .
oh yes , yes , yes , yes , yes ! always the same stale answers ! there is no god of mercy , father . just a god of torture .
what ?
his funeral imagine it ! the cathedral , all vienna sitting there . his coffin , mozart's little coffin in the middle . and suddenly in that silence , music . a divine music bursts out over them all , a great mass of death requiem mass for wolfgang mozart , composed by his devoted friend antonio salieri . what sublimity ! what depth ! what passion in the music ! salieri has been touched by god at last . and god , forced to listen . powerless powerless to stop it . i at the end , for once , laughing at him . do you understand ? do you ?
yes .
the only thing that worried me was the actual killing . how does one do that ? how does one kill a man ? it's one thing to dream about it . it's very different when you have to do it , with your own hands .
why ? why ? why ? why add to your misery by confessing to murder ? you didn't kill him .
i did .
no , you didn't !
i poisoned his life .
but not his body .
what difference does that make ?
my son , why should you want all vienna to believe you a murderer ? is that your penance ? is it ?
no , father . from now on no one will be able to speak of mozart without thinking of me . whenever they say mozart with love , they'll have to say salieri with loathing . and that's my immortality at last ! our names will be tied together for eternity his in fame and mine in infamy . at least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me , your merciful god !
oh my son , my poor son !
don't pity me . pity yourself . you serve a wicked god . he killed mozart , not i . took him , snatched him away , without pity . he destroyed his beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory . he doesn't care . understand that . god cares nothing for the man he denies and nothing either for the man he uses . he broke mozart in half when he'd finished with him , and threw him away . like an old , worn out flute .
i don't think it was really decided , director .
oh , german ! german ! please let it be german .
my dear fellow , the language is not finally the point . do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre ?
why not ? it's charming . i mean , i don't actually show concubines exposing their ! their ! it's not indecent ! it's highly moral , majesty . it's full of proper german virtues . i swear it . absolutely !
well done , mozart . really quite fine .
baron !
mozart
sire , only opera can do this . in a play , if more than one person speaks at the same time , it's just noise . no one can understand a word . but with music , with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once , and it's not noise it's a perfect harmony . isn't that marvelous ?
mozart , music is not the issue here . no one doubts your talent . it is your judgment of literature that's in question . even with the politics taken out , this thing would still remain a vulgar farce . why waste your spirit on such rubbish ? surely you can choose more elevated themes ?
elevated ? what does that mean ? elevated ! the only thing a man should elevate is oh , excuse me . i'm sorry . i'm stupid . but i am fed up to the teeth with elevated things ! old dead legends ! how can we go on forever writing about gods and legends ?
because they do . they go on forever at least what they represent . the eternal in us , not the ephemeral . opera is here to ennoble us . you and me , just as much as his majesty .
what is this , herr chamberlain ?
what is what ?
why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee ? just to teach a sixteen year old girl .
because his majesty wishes it .
is the emperor angry with me ?
on the contrary .
then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post ?
mozart , you are not the only composer in vienna .
no , but i'm the best .
a little modesty would suit you better .
who is on this committee ?
kapellmeister bonno , count orsini rosenberg and court composer salieri .
naturally , the italians ! of course ! always the italians !
mozart
they hate my music . it terrifies them . the only sound italians understand is banality . tonic and dominant , tonic and dominant , from here to resurrection ! ba ba ! ba ba ! ba ba ! ba ba ! anything else is morbid .
mozart
show them one interesting modulation and they faint . ohime ! morbidezza ! morbidezza ! italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music !
look , young man , the issue is simple . if you want this post , you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues .
must i ? well , i won't ! i tell you straight i will not !
herr mozart
may i just do that , majesty ? show you how it begins ? just that ?
oh ? have i seen it ?
i i don't think you have , herr director . not yet . i mean , it's quite n of course , i'll show it to you immediately .
you mean in turkey ?
exactly .
then why especially does it have to be in german ?
well not especially . it can be in turkish , if you really want . i don't care .
what you think , mozart , is scarcely the point . it is what his majesty thinks that counts .
but , your majesty
that will do , herr mozart !
just let me tell you how it begins .
mozart ! herr mozart , may i have a word with you please . right away .
certainly , herr director .
did you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas ?
yes , but this is not a ballet . this is a dance at figaro's wedding .
exactly . a dance .
but surely the emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story .
it is dangerous for you to interpret his majesty's edicts . give me your score , please .
what are you doing , herr director ?
can we see the scene with the music back , please ?
i know your work well , signore . do you know i actually composed some variations on a melody of yours ?
really ?
mio caro adone .
ah !
love , sire !
yes ! yes ! er , on the whole , yes , majesty .
but this is absurd !
dear mozart , my sincere congratulations .
did you like it , then ?
how could i not ?
it really is the best music one can hear in vienna today . don't you agree ?
herr mozart , what brings you here ?
your excellency , you requested some specimens of my work . here they are . i don't have to tell you how much i need your help . i truly appreciate your looking at these . i have pressures on me financial pressures . as you know , i'm a married man now .
so you are . how is your pretty wife ?
she is well . she is well , actually , i'm about to become a father ! she only told me last night . you are the first to know .
i'm flattered . and congratulations to you , of course .
so you see , this post is very important to me right now .
why didn't you come to me yesterday , mozart ? this is a most painful situation . yesterday i could have helped you . today , i can't .
why ? here is the music . it's here . i am submitting it humbly . isn't that what you wanted ?
i have just come from the palace . the post has been filled .
filled ? that's impossible ! they haven't even seen my work . i need this post . please , can't you help me ? please !
my dear mozart , there is no one in the world i would rather help , but now it is too late .
whom did they choose ?
herr sommer .
sommer ? herr sommer ? but the man's a fool ! he's a total mediocrity .
no , no , no he has yet to achieve mediocrity .
but i can't lose this post , i simply can't ! excellency , please . let's go to the palace , and you can explain to the emperor that herr sommer is an awful choice . he could actually do musical harm to the princess !
an implausible idea . between you and me , no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess elizabeth .
look , i must have pupils . without pupils i can't manage .
you don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty ?
no , but i'm broke . i'm always broke . i don't know why .
it has been said , my friend , that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means .
how can anyone say that ? we have no cook , no maid . we have no footman . nothing at all !
how is that possible ? you give concerts , don't you ? i hear they are quite successful .
they're stupendously successful . you can't get a seat . the only problem is none will hire me . they all want to hear me play , but they won't let me teach their daughters . as if i was some kind of fiend . i'm not a fiend !
of course not .
do you have a daughter ?
i'm afraid not .
well , could you lend me some money till you have one ? then i'll teach her for free . that's a promise . oh , i'm sorry . i'm being silly . papa's right i should put a padlock on my mouth . seriously , is there any chance you could manage a loan ? only for six months , eight at most . after that i'll be the richest man in vienna . i'll pay you back double . anything . name your terms . i'm not joking . i'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over europe !
ah , how exciting ! tell me more .
i'd better not . it's a bit of a secret .
come , come , mozart i'm interested . truly .
actually , it's a big secret . oh , this is delicious ! what is it ?
cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum . crema al mascarpone .
ah . italian ?
forgive me . we all have patriotic feelings of some kind .
two thousand , two hundred florins is all i need a hundred ? fifty ?
what exactly are you working on ?
i can't say . really
wolfgang , what is it ? sta calmo , per favore . what's the matter ?
it's unbelievable ! the director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music . pages of it .
really ? why ?
i don't know . they say i've got to re write the opera , but it's perfect as it is . i can't rewrite what's perfect . can't you talk to him ?
why bother with orsini rosenberg ? he's obviously no friend of yours .
oh , i could kill him ! i mean really kill him . i actually threw the entire opera on the fire , he made me so angry !
you burned the score ?
oh no ! my wife took it out in time .
how fortunate .
it's not fair that a man like that has power over our work .
but there are those who have power over him . i think i'll take this up with the emperor .
oh , excellency , would you ?
with all my heart , mozart .
nine performances ! nine ! that's all it's had and withdrawn .
i know it's outrageous . still , if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully .
but what is it they don't like ?
well , i can speak for the emperor . you made too many demands on the royal ear . the poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four .
what did you think of it yourself ? did you like it at all ?
i think it's marvelous . truly .
it's the best opera yet written . i know it ! why didn't they come ?
i think you overestimate our dear viennese , my friend . do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap ?
i know , i know . perhaps you should give me some lessons in that .
i wouldn't presume . all the same , if it wouldn't be imposing , i would like you to see my new piece . it would be a tremendous honour for me .
oh no , the honour would be all mine .
grazie , mio caro , wolfgang !
grazie , a lei , signor antonio !
mozart . it was good of you to come .
how could i not ?
did my work please you ?
how could it not , excellency ?
yes ?
i never knew that music like that was possible .
you flatter me .
oh no ! one hears such sounds and what can one say , but salieri !
i have come to commission work from you .
what work ?
a mass for the dead .
what dead ? who is dead ?
a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one .
who are you ?
i am only a messenger . do you accept ? you will be paid well .
how long will you give me ?
work fast . and be sure to tell no one what you do . you will see me again soon .
i don't have it yet . it's not finished . i'm sorry , but i need more time .
are you neglecting my request ?
what happened ? is it over ?
i'm taking you home . you're not well .
no , no . i have to get back . i have
where is your wife ?
not here ! she's not well , either . she went to the spa .
you mean she's not coming back ?
you're so good to me . truly . thank you .
no , please .
i mean to come to my opera . you are the only colleague who did .
i would never miss anything that you had written . you must know that .
this is only a vaudeville .
oh no . it is a sublime piece . the grandest operone . i tell you , you are the greatest composer known to me .
do you mean that ?
i do .
i have bad fancies . i don't sleep well anymore . then i drink too much , and think stupid things .
are you ill ?
the doctor thinks i am . but
what ?
i'm too young to be so sick .
shall i answer it ?
no ! no , it's him !
who ?
the man . he's here .
what man ?
wait ! ask him if he'd give me some money now . tell him if he would , that would help me finish it .
finish what ?
another ? but that's too soon ! tomorrow night ? it's impossible ! did he say a hundred ?
yes . can i could i help you , in any way ?
would you ? actually , you could .
my dear friend , it would be my greatest pleasure .
but you'd have to swear not to tell a soul . i'm not allowed .
of course .
you know , it's all here in my head . it's just ready to be set down . but when i'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus . i can't write .
then , let us try together . i'd regard it as such an honour . tell me , what is this work ?
where did i stop ?
the end of the recordare statuens in parte dextra .
so now the confutatis . confutatis maledictis . when the wicked are confounded . flammis acribus addictis . how would you translate that ?
consigned to flames of woe .
do you believe in it ?
what ?
a fire which never dies . burning one forever ?
oh , yes .
strange !
confutatis maledictis .
we ended in f major ?
yes .
the fire .
what time ?
start with the voices . basses first . second beat of the first measure a . con fu ta tis . second measure , second beat . ma le dic tis . g sharp , of course .
yes .
third measure , second beat starting on e . flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis . and fourth measure , fourth beat d . ma le dic tis , flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis . do you have that ?
i think so .
good . now the tenors . fourth beat of the first measure c . con fu ta tis . second measure , fourth beat on d . ma le dic tis . all right ?
yes .
now the orchestra . second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses . identical notes and rhythm . the first bassoon and tenor trombone
please ! just one moment .
it couldn't be simpler .
first bassoon and tenor trombone what ?
with the tenors .
also identical ?
exactly . the instruments to go with the voices . trumpets and timpani , tonic and dominant .
and that's all ?
do you have me ?
i think so .
show me .
that's wonderful !
c major . sopranos and altos in thirds . altos on c . sopranos above . vo ca , vo ca me , vo ca me cum be ne dic tis .
sopranos up to f on the second 'voca' ?
yes , and on 'dictis' .
yes !
and that's it . do you have it ?
you go fast !
do you have it ?
yes .
do you want to rest a bit ?
oh no . i'm not tired at all .
we'll stop for just a moment . then we'll do the lacrimosa .
i can keep going , i assure you . shall we try ?
would you stay with me while i sleep a little ?
i'm not leaving you .
i am so ashamed .
what for ?
i was foolish . i thought you did not care for my work or me . forgive me . forgive me !
quiet ! quiet ! quiet ! down there , damn you . welcome to you . pay no attention , they're impossible . stop it , you willful things ! come this way . just ignore them . they're perfectly harmless , just willful . i treat them just like my own children .
and which one of them do you want me to teach ?
you won't be teaching this one either . she's my wife .
madame .
this is herr mozart , my dear . the young man herr salieri recommended to teach our gertrude . where is she ?
i'm afraid i am .
of course , it's him . who do you think it is ?
good morning , fraulein schlumberg .
never mind , strudel . it's part of music , getting used to an audience . aren't i right , herr mozart ?
well , yes ! on the whole . i suppose . how long have you been playing , fraulein ?
it's a miracle , herr mozart !
well , i'm a good teacher . the next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs , please let me know . goodbye , fraulein , goodbye , madame ! goodbye , sir !
herr mozart . what a surprise . what can i do for you ?
is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music ?
well , your pupil is married and living in mannheim , young man .
really ? perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction ?
what is this , mozart ? what's the matter with you ?
well . since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services , could you favour me with a little money instead ?
what for ?
if a man cannot earn , he must borrow .
well , this is hardly the way to go about it .
no doubt , sir . but i am endowed with talent , and you with money . if i offer mine , you should offer yours .
i'm sorry . no .
please . i'll give it back , i promise . please , sir .
my answer is no , mozart .
sssh !
stanzi manzi banzi wanzi !
sssh ! stay here .
what did he say ? what did he say ?
well ?
sublime ! utterly sublime !
wonderful ! he liked the monkey , didn't you ?
yes , well , it's all good fun .
i liked the horse .
isn't he marvelous ? he cost me a bundle , that horse , but he's worth it . i tell you , if you'd played don giovanni here it would have been a great success . i'm not joking . these people aren't fools . you could do something marvelous for them .
i'd like to try them someday . i'm not sure i'd be much good at it .
'course you would . you belong here , my boy , not the snobby court . you could do anything you felt like here the more fantastic the better ! that's what people want , you know fantasy . you do a big production , fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want . of course , you'd have to put a fire in it , because i've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood i can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life . oh , and a few trick animals . you'd have to use those .
animals ?
i'm serious . you write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs , i'll guarantee you'll have a triumph de luxe . mind you , it'll have to be in german .
german !
of course ! what else do you think they speak here ?
no , no , i love that . i'd want it to be in german . i haven't done anything in german since seraglio .
so there you are . what do you say ?
leave that alone !
wolfi !
put it down !
what is this ?
put it down , i said ! it's nothing for you .
oh ! i'm sorry ! i'm sorry ! what have you got for me ? is it finished ?
what ?
what ? the vaudeville , what'd you think ?
yes .
can i see it ?
no .
why not ?
because there's nothing to see .
look , i asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes .
well , we can .
so let me see it . where is it ?
yes ?
are you herr mozart ?
that's right .
my name is lorl , sir . i'm a maidservant . i was asked to come here and offer my services to you .
what ?
they'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon anonymous .
are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is ?
yes . i can live in or out just as you wish .
ah ! here she comes . fraulein lorl , good morning .
good morning , sir .
ah ha ! siena macaroons my favourites . give my best thanks to the baker .
i will , sir .
thank you . are you well today , fraulein lorl ?
yes , thank you , sir .
bene ! bene !
madame cavalieri is here for her lesson , sir .
bene .
oh , thank you , sir .
do any pupils come to the house ?
not that i've seen .
then how does he pay for all this ? does he work at all ?
oh , yes , sir , all day long . he never leaves the house until evening . he just sits there , writing and writing . he doesn't even eat .
really ? what is it he's writing ?
oh , i wouldn't know that , sir .
of course not . you're a good girl . you're very kind to do this . next time you're sure they'll be out of the house , let me know , will you ?
i think i've found out about the money , sir .
where does he work ?
in there , sir .
now calm yourself . calm . what's the matter with you ?
i'm leaving . i'm not working there anymore . i'm scared !
why ? what has happened ?
you don't know what it's like . herr mozart frightens me . he drinks all day , then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse .
what medicine ?
i don't know . he has pains .
where ?
here , in his stomach . they bend him right over .
is he working ?
i'm frightened , sir . really ! when he speaks , he doesn't make any sense . you know he said he saw he said he saw his father . and his father's dead .
is he working ?
i suppose so . he sits there all he time , doing some silly opera .
opera ? opera !
please don't ask me to go back again . i'm frightened ! i'm very , very frightened .
are you sure it's an opera ?
i write to you with urgent news . i am coming to vienna . take no further steps toward marriage until we meet . you are too gullible to see your own danger . as you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours , do as i bid , and await my coming .
why are you here ?
am i not welcome ?
feed ? well , of course she feeds me . she stuffs me like a goose all day long . she's the best cook in the world . i mean , since mama . just wait , you'll see .
is she not here ?
i don't know . stanzi ? stanzi !
do you always live like this ?
she's very tired , poor creature . you know me i'm a real pig . it's not so easy cleaning up after me .
don't you have a maid ?
oh we could , if we wanted to , but stanzi won't hear of it . she wants to do everything herself .
how is your financial situation ?
it couldn't be better .
that's not what i hear .
what do you mean ? it's wonderful . really , it's it's marvelous ! people love me here .
they say you're in debt .
who ? who says that ? now that's a malicious lie !
how many pupils do you have ?
pupils ?
yes .
yes .
how many ?
i don't know . it's not important . i mean , i don't want pupils . they get in the way . i've got to have time for composition .
composition doesn't pay . you know that .
this one will .
what's that ?
oh , let's not talk about it .
why not ?
it's a secret .
you don't have secrets from me .
isn't that marvelous ? we're delighted .
why didn't you mention it in your letters ?
didn't i ? i thought i did . i'm sure i did .
thank you . that'll be fine . don't spend any money on me .
why not ? oh , come , papa ! what better way could i spend it than on you ? my kissable , missable , suddenly visible papa !
no , really !
yes , papa , name it . name it . i'll do anything you say !
i'm tired of this game . please play without me .
papa , is this your idea ?
mine ?
are you playing a trick on me ?
never mind . you won't have to do anything for me ever again . i'm leaving !
papa !
don't worry , i'm not staying here to be a burden .
no one calls you that .
she does . she says i sleep all day .
father
hush ! i'm talking to his majesty . your majesty , i wish to express only one thing that you who are the father of us all , could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers . it is not for nothing that the fifth commandment tells us 'honour your father and mother , that your days may be long upon the earth . '
ah ha . well then , we should make some effort to acquire him . we could use a good german composer in vienna , surely ?
i agree , majesty , but i'm afraid it's not possible . the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop .
ah ha . what do you say , chamberlain ?
yes , sir .
well , what do you have for me today ?
your majesty , herr mozart
yes , what about him ?
he's here .
ah ha . well . there it is . good .
your majesty !
no , no , please ! it is not a holy relic . you know we have met already ? in this very room . perhaps you won't remember it , you were only six years old . he was giving the most brilliant little concert here . as he got off the stool , he slipped and fell . my sister antoinette helped him up herself , and do you know what he did ? jumped straight into her arms and said , will you marry me , yes or no ?
oh , thank you .
the director of our opera . count orsini rosenberg .
oh sir , yes ! the honour is mine . absolutely .
and now he has returned the compliment . herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you .
majesty !
why so ?
because i've already found the most wonderful libretto !
well , what is it about ? tell us the story .
it's actually quite amusing , majesty . it's set the whole thing is set in a in a
yes , where ?
in a pasha's harem , majesty . a seraglio .
ah ha .
keep it , sire , if you want to . it is already here in my head .
what ? on one hearing only ?
it is new , it is , isn't it , sire ?
yes , indeed .
and german ?
oh , yes . absolutely . german . unquestionably !
so then you like it ? you really like it , your majesty ?
of course i do . it's very good . of course now and then just now and then it gets a touch elaborate .
what do you mean , sire ?
well , i mean occasionally it seems to have , how shall one say ? how shall one say , director ?
i don't understand . there are just as many notes , majesty , as are required . neither more nor less .
my dear , young man , don't take it too hard . your work is ingenious . it's quality work . and there are simply too many notes , that's all . cut a few and it will be perfect .
majesty , this is madame weber . she is my landlady .
really ? how delightful . may i ask when you marry ?
well well we haven't quite received my father's consent , your majesty . not entirely . not altogether .
excuse me , but how old are you ?
twenty six .
bravo , mozart . most charming . yes , indeed . clever man .
majesty , may i ask you to do me the greatest favour ?
what is it ?
may i introduce my father ? he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to salzburg . he would so much like to kiss your hand . it would make his whole stay so memorable for him .
mozart , are you aware i have declared the french play of figaro unsuitable for our theatre ?
yes , sire .
yet we hear you are making an opera from it . is this true ?
who told you this , majesty ?
it is not your place to ask questions . is it true ?
well , yes , i admit it is .
would you tell me why ?
well , majesty , it is only a comedy .
mozart , i am a tolerant man . i do not censor things lightly . when i do , i have good reason . figaro is a bad play . it stirs up hatred between the classes . in france it has caused nothing but bitterness . my own dear sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people . i do not wish to see the same fears starting here .
sire , i swear to your majesty , there's nothing like that in the story . i have taken out everything that could give offense . i hate politics .
i think you are rather innocent , my friend . in these dangerous times i cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece .
but , majesty , this is just a frolic . it's a piece about love .
ah , love again .
but it's new , it's entirely new . it's so new , people will go mad for it . for example , i have a scene in the second act it starts as a duet , just a man and wife quarreling . suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly a very funny situation . duet turns into trio . then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in . trio turns into quartet . then a stupid old gardener quartet becomes quintet , and so on . on and on , sextet , septet , octet ! how long do you think i can sustain that ?
i have no idea .
guess ! guess , majesty . imagine the longest time such a thing could last , then double it .
well , six or seven minutes ! maybe eight !
forgive me , majesty . i'm a vulgar man . but i assure you , my music is not .
you are passionate , mozart ! but you do not persuade .
sire , the whole opera is finished . do you know how much work went into it ?
i think it is an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna , majesty . it should really infuriate the archbishop beyond measure if that is your majesty's intention .
what a charming idea . may i see ?
it's just a trifle , of course .
may i try it ?
majesty .
delightful , court composer . would you permit me to play it as he comes in ?
you do me too much honour , sire .
let's have some fun . bring in herr mozart , please . but slowly , slowly . i need a minute to practice .
a flat , majesty .
and here is our illustrious court composer , herr salieri .
my pleasure .
well , i'm glad to hear that .
excuse me , sire , but what do you think these could be ? being a foreigner , i would love to learn .
good morning , court composer . this is my niece , the princess elizabeth .
oh , your majesty , it would be such a tremendous honour !
i'm thinking about herr mozart . what is your view ?
an interesting idea , majesty . but
yes ?
you already commissioned an opera from mozart .
and the result satisfies .
yes , of course . my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism .
ah ha . favouritism . but i so want mozart .
i'm sure there is a way , majesty . some kind of a little contest . i could perhaps put together a small committee , and i could see to it naturally that it will select according to your majesty's wishes .
you please me , court composer . a very clever idea .
sire .
i don't think you understand me , court composer .
majesty , i did . believe me , it was a most agonizing . decision . but finally , i simply could not recommend herr mozart .
why not ?
well , sire , i made some inquiries in a routine way . i was curious to know why he had so few pupils . it is rather alarming .
oh ?
majesty , i don't like to talk against a fellow musician .
of course not .
i have to tell you , mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies .
really ?
as a matter of fact , one of my own pupils a very young singer told me she was er well !
yes ?
molested , majesty . twice , in the course of the same lesson .
do you like this , salieri ?
it is not a question of liking , your majesty . your own law decrees it , i'm afraid .
well , look at them .
really ?
perhaps a little refreshment first ? a little coffee , or a little chocolate ?
i'd like a little wine , if you have it .
just one year .
who was your teacher ?
i was . but she quite outgrew the little i could show her .
thank you , madame . come on now courage . play me something you know .
upstairs .
gertrude !
i've heard about you for ages ! i thought you must be an old man .
gertrude !
it's such an honour for us to have you here , herr mozart . and for gertrude .
people who know say the girl's got talent . you must judge for yourself . if you think she stinks , say so .
michael , please ! i'm sure you will find her most willing , herr mozart . she's really very excited . she's been preparing all morning .
i said play !
what a strange young man .
yes . he is a little strange .
let us pass , please ! let us pass at once ! we're with the emperor .
i am sorry , madame . it is not permitted .
do you know who i am ? this is my daughter . i am frau weber . we are favoured guests !
i am sorry , madame , but i have my orders .
call herr mozart ! you call herr mozart immediately ! this is insupportable !
i am sorry , madame , but no ! i cannot let anyone pass .
young man , i am no stranger to theatres . i'm no stranger to insolence !
be careful !
be careful !
he's adorable !
adorable !
behold !
behold !
hey !
hey !
behold !
behold !
i see that you're expecting .
oh , yes .
when , may i ask ?
what is ridiculous ? wolfi has many admirers in vienna . they love him here . people send us gifts all the time .
but you can't take her without reference . it's unheard of !
and so you do ! the only time you come out is to eat .
and what do you expect ? who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day ?
oh , now i'm a bad housekeeper !
so you are ! the place is a pigsty all the time .
how much will you pay him ?
am i interrupting something ?
not at all .
where's our friend ?
he's not in . but he's working on it . he said to tell you .
look , you little clown , do you know how many people i've hired for you ? do you know how many people are waiting ?
leave him alone !
i'm paying these people . do you realize that ?
he's doing his best .
i'm paying people just to wait for you . it's ridiculous !
you know what's ridiculous ? your libretto , that's what's ridiculous . only an idiot would ask wolfi to work on that stuff !
oh yes ? and what's so intelligent about writing a requiem ?
money ! money !
you're mad ! she's mad , wolfi .
excellency !
frau mozart ?
that's right , your excellency . i've come on behalf of my hus band . i'm i'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment .
how charming . but why did he not come himself ?
he's terribly busy , sir .
i will look at them , of course , the moment i can . it will be an honour . please give him my warmest .
would it be too much trouble , sir , to ask you to look at them now ? while i wait .
i'm afraid i'm not at leisure this very moment . just leave them with me . i assure you they will be quite safe .
i i really cannot do that , your excellency . you see , he doesn't know i'm here .
really ?
my husband is a proud man , sir . he would be furious if he knew i'd come .
then he didn't send you ?
no , sir . this is my own idea .
i see .
thank you very much , your excellency .
are you sure you can't leave that music , and come back again ? i have other things you might like .
that's very tempting , but it's impossible , i'm afraid . wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing . you see , they're all originals .
originals ?
yes .
these are originals ?
yes , sir . he doesn't make copies .
it is miraculous .
oh yes . he's really proud of his work .
tomorrow night i dine with the emperor . one word from me and the post is his .
oh , thank you , sir !
come back tonight .
tonight ?
alone .
what for ?
some service deserves service in return . no ?
what do you mean ?
it's a post all vienna seeks . if you want it for your husband , come tonight .
but ! i'm a married woman !
then don't . it's up to you . not to be vague , that is the price .
i do apologize for this afternoon . i behaved like a silly girl . where shall we go ?
what ?
what are you doing here ?
your husband is ill , ma'am . he took sick . i brought him home .
why you ?
i was at hand .
well , thank you very much . you can go now .
he needs me , ma'am .
no , he doesn't . and i don't want you here . just go , please .
he asked me to stay .
this is not his handwriting .
no . i was assisting him . he asked me .
i regret we have no servants to show you out , herr salieri . respect my wish and go .
madame , i will respect his . he asked me to stay here .
stop it !
i am ! i am ! i'm stopping it slowly . you see ! look , i've stopped . now we are going back .
no ! no ! no !
yes ! back ! back ! listen don't you know where you are ?
where ?
we are in the residence of the fartsbishop of salzburg .
your grace , i've got something to tell you . i want to complain about this man .
go ahead , tell him . tell them all . they won't understand you anyway .
why not ?
because here everything goes backwards . people walk backwards , dance backwards , sing backwards , and talk backwards .
that's stupid .
why ? people fart backwards .
do you think that's funny ?
yes , i think it's brilliant . you've been doing it for years .
oh , ha , ha , ha .
sra i'm sick ! sra i'm sick !
yes , you are . you're very sick .
no , no . say it backwards , shit wit . sra i'm sick say it backwards !
sra i'm sick . sick kiss i'm my kiss my ! sra i'm sick kiss my arse !
em iram ! em iram !
no , i'm not playing this game .
no , this is serious . say it backwards .
no !
just say it you'll see . it's very serious . em iram ! em iram !
iram marry em marry me ! no , no ! you're a fiend . i'm not going to marry a fiend . a dirty fiend at that .
ui vol i tub !
tub but i tub but i vol love but i love ui you . i love you !
tish i'm tee . what's that ?
what ?
tish i'm tee .
eat
yes .
excuse me , wolfi . mama is not feeling very well . can we leave now ?
of course .
i think you're mad ! you're really mad !
oh , leave me alone .
one royal pupil and the whole of vienna will come flocking . we'd be set up for life !
they'll come anyway . they love me here .
no , they will not . i know how things work in this city .
oh yes ? you always know everything .
well , i'm not borrowing any more money from my mother , and that's that !
you borrowed money from your mother ?
yes !
well , don't do that again !
how are we going to live , wolfi ? do you want me to go into the streets and beg ?
don't be stupid .
all they want to see is your work . what's wrong with that ?
shut up ! just shut up ! i don't need them .
this isn't pride . it's sheer stupidity !
stop it now . stop it . i've brought some friends to meet you . they're next door waiting . do we have anything to eat ? they're all starving .
tell them to go away . i don't want to see anybody .
what's the matter with you ?
tell them to go !
sssh . what is it ? tell me .
no !
yes !
i love you ! i love you !
my stanzi look at her ! isn't she beautiful ? come on now , confess , papa . could you want a prettier girl for a daughter ?
stop it , wolfi . i look dreadful . welcome to our house , herr mozart .
he's not herr mozart . call him papa .
may i offer you some tea , herr mozart ?
tea ? who wants tea ? let's go out ! this calls for a feast . you don't want tea , papa . let's go dancing . papa loves parties , don't you ?
wolfi !
what ? how can you be so boring ? tea !
there's a young girl to see you .
what does she want ?
i don't know .
well , ask her !
she won't talk to me . she says she has to speak to you .
oh , damn !
look , old man , you stay out of this . we spend a fortune on you , more than we can possibly afford , and all you do is criticize , morning to night . and then you think you can
stanzi !
no , it's right he should hear . i'm sick to death of it . we can't do anything right for you , can we ?
we'll have a little party . come in . come in . you know herr schikaneder ? this is ! a very nice girl .
wolfi .
yes , my love ?
these gentlemen are from salzburg .
salzburg . we were just talking about salzburg . if you've come from my friend the fartsbishop , you've arrived at just the right moment . because i've got good news for him . i'm done with vienna . it's over , finished , done with ! done with ! done with !
wolfi ! your father is dead .
what ?
your father is dead .
half the receipts ! stanzi !
you're not going to do this ?
why not ? half the house !
when ? we need money now . either he pays now , or you don't do it .
oh , stanzi .
i don't trust this man . and i didn't like what he did with your opera . it was common .
well , you liked it , didn't you ? monkey flunki punki .
half the house ! you'll never see a penny . i want it here , in my hand .
stanzi manzi , i'll put it in your hand !
who was that ?
no one .
what's that ? oh ! who gave you this ? how much is it ? wolfi , who gave you this ?
i'm not telling you .
why not ?
no . don't answer it !
why ?
this is my wife , stanzi . i've been sick , but i'm all right now . aren't i ?
oh yes , sir . he's all right . and he's working on it very hard .
give me two more weeks . please .
give me one reason i can understand .
i can't write it !
why not ?
go back to bed .
please ! let me sit here . let me stay here with you . i promise i won't say all word . i'll just be here , so you know no one's going to hurt you . please , please !
what is it ?
i want to go !
where ?
i want to go back to vienna .
now ?
yes !
why ?
i feel wrong . i feel wrong being here .
what are you talking about ?
don giovannnnnnnni !
who the devil are you ? what do you want ?
i've come to dinnnnnner !
dinner ? how dare you ? i am a nobleman . i only dine with people of my own height .
are you drunk ? you invited me . and my horse . here he is . ottavio !
in the pot , i have got a good dinner . not a sausage or stew , but a singer . not a sausage or stew but a singer . is the treat that i'll eat for my meat !
oh shut up . i'm sick to death of that tune .
why what , sir ?
why do i have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants ?
humiliated ?
how much provocation am i to endure from you ? the more license i allow you , the more you take .
if his grace is not satisfied with me , he can dismiss me .
i wish you to return immediately to salzburg . your father is waiting for you there patiently . i will speak to you further when i come .
no , your grace ! i mean with all humility , no . i would rather you dismissed me . it's obvious i don't satisfy .
no ! i won't have him back .
but he needs to be here in salzburg , your grace . he needs me and he needs you . your protection , your understanding .
hardly .
oh sir , yes ! he's about to make the worst mistake of his life . some little viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage . i know my son . he is too simple to see the trap and there is no one there who really cares for him .
i'm not surprised . money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship . he has sold himself to vienna . let vienna look out for him .
sir
your son is an unprincipled , spoiled , conceited brat .
yes , sir , that's the truth . but don't blame him . the fault is mine . i was too indulgent with him . but not again . never again , i promise ! i implore you let me bring him back here . i'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully .
and how will you make him keep it ?
oh , sir , he's never disobeyed me in anything . please , your grace , give him one more chance .
you have leave to try .
oh , your grace i thank your grace ! i thank you !
katherina ! i'll tell you what i'm going to do . i'm going to write another aria for you . something even more amazing for the second act . i have to get some water . her mother is lying on the stage .
don't bother !
what ?
don't bother .
oh excuse me !
is her mother still lying on the floor ?
no , she's fine .
is she a good fuck ?
what ?
no , no , no , no . you can't take him away now . this is his night . won't you introduce us , wolfgang ?
excuse us , fraulein . good night , signore .
maestro .
good morning .
well ? how do you like it ? it's turkish . my hairdresser tells me everything's going to be turkish this year !
really ? what else did he tell you today ? give me some gossip .
well , i heard you met herr mozart .
oh ? news travels fast in vienna .
and he's been commissioned to write an opera . is it true ?
yes .
is there a part for me ?
no .
how do you know ?
well even if there is , i don't think you want to get involved with this one .
why not ?
well , do you know where it's set , my dear ?
where ?
in a harem .
what's that ?
a brothel .
oh !
a turkish brothel .
turkish ? oh , if it's turkish , that's different . i want to be in it .
my dear , it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout vienna as a singing prostitute for a turk .
oh . well perhaps you could introduce us anyway .
perhaps .
what does he look like ?
you might be disappointed .
why ?
looks and talent don't always go together , katherina .
did you know ? had you heard ?
what ?
the marriage !
well , what does it matter to you ?
how was i ? tell me honestly .
you were sublime .
what did you think of the music ?
extremely clever .
meaning you didn't like it .
follow me , please . the archbishop would like a word .
well , i think that went off remarkably well , don't you ?
indeed .
these viennese certainly know good music when they hear it .
his grace is very angry with you .
what do you mean ?
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno's wish . a willing , billing , lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish . be my most tasty little dish ! be my most tasty little dish !
then that would be eating and drinking i'd live like a prince without thinking . the wisdom of old would be mine a woman's much better than wine ! then that would be eating and drinking ! the wisdom of old would be mine a woman's much better than wine . she's much better than wine ! she's much better than wine !
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno's wish . a willing , billing , lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish .
i need to net one birdie only and i will stop feeling so lonely . but if she won't fly to my aid , then into a ghost i must fade . i need to net one birdie only but if she won't fly to my aid , then into a ghost i must fade . to a ghost i must fade ! to a ghost i must fade !
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno's wish . a willing , billing , lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish .
look , i told you .
the analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe .
look , i can see where this is going . but i'm telling you those things exist . back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs . thousands . do you understand ? i suggest you find it , using the flight recorder's data . find it and deal with it before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise .
thank you , officer ripley . that will be .
why won't you check out lv ?
because i don't have to . the people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship . and by the way , they call it acheron now .
how many colonists ?
sixty , maybe seventy families .
what did you say ?
casey . she's my only friend .
what about me ?
i don't want you for a friend .
why not ?
because you'll be gone soon , like the others . like everybody . you'll be dead and you'll leave me alone .
they'd be here if they could , honey . i know they would .
they're dead .
newt . look at me . newt . i won't leave you . i promise .
you promise ?
cross my heart .
i was the best at the game . i knew the whole maze .
the 'maze' ? you mean the air ducts ?
yeah , you know . in the walls , under the floor . i was the ace . i could hide better than anybody .
you're really something , ace .
i guess we're not leaving , right ?
i'm sorry , newt .
you don't have to be sorry . it wasn't your fault .
now you just lie here and have a nap . you're exhausted .
ripley . she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic .
oh . sorry , newt .
my mommy always said there were no monsters . no real ones . but there are .
yes , there are , aren't there .
why do they tell little kids that ?
well , some kids can't handle it like you can .
did one of those things grow inside her ?
i don't know , newt . that's the truth .
isn't that how babies come ? i mean people babies . they grow inside you ?
no , it's different , honey .
did you ever have a baby ?
yes . a little girl .
where is she ?
gone .
don't go ! please .
newt . newt , wake up .
wah . ? where are . ?
sssh . don't move . we're in trouble .
mommy . i mean , ripley . i'm scared .
burke ! open the door !
come on . crawl faster .
do you know how to get to the landing field from here ?
this way . come on , we're almost there !
newt , wait !
i knew you'd come .
newt , i want you to hang on , now . hang on tight .
mommy . mommy ?
right here , baby . right here .
are we going to sleep now ?
that's right .
can we dream ?
yes , honey . i think we both can .
and how are we today ?
terrible .
just terrible ? that's better than yesterday at least .
how long have i been on gateway station ?
bad dreams again ? do you want something to help you sleep ?
no . i've slept enough .
you remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau , out past the ilium range , a couple days ago ?
yeah . what ?
there's a guy on the horn , mom and pop survey team . says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored .
christ . some honch in a cushy office on earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere , we look . they don't say why , and i don't ask . i don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask . '
so what do i tell this guy ?
tell him , as far as i'm concerned , he finds something it's his .
sounds like you , hicks .
looks like it stung him .
hey . hey ! look , crowe and dietrich aren't dead , man .
you can't help them . right now they're being cocooned just like the others .
man , we're not going to make it seventeen hours ! those things are going to come in here , just like they did before , man . they're going to come in here and get us , man , long before .
this service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth .
yeah , right , it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here .
thanks .
uh , what's next ?
we need the other drop ship . the on one the sulaco . we have to bring it down on remote , somehow .
how ? the transmitter was on the apc . it's wasted .
i don't care how ! think of a way . think of something .
think of what ? we're fucked .
well then somebody's just going to have to go out there . take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually .
oh , right ! right ! with those things running around . no way .
they cut the power .
this signal's weird . must be some interference or something . there's movement all over the place .
just get back here !
range twenty meters .
seal the door .
fifteen meters .
i don't know , an acid hole in a duct . something under the floors , not on the plans . i don't know !
twelve meters . man , this is a big fucking signal . ten meters .
they're right on us . vasquez , how you doing ?
nine meters . eight .
can't be . that's inside the room !
hey , vasquez . you ever been mistaken for a man ?
no . have you ?
somebody said alien . she thought they said illegal alien and signed up .
fuck you .
anytime . anywhere .
all right , we can't blow the fuck out of them . why not roll some canisters of cn down there . nerve gas the whole nest ?
look , man , let's just bug out and call it even , okay ?
yeah , bullshit . watch us .
oh , man . and i was gettin' short , too ! four more weeks and out . now i'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock . it ain't half fair , man !
hudson , give us a break .
it's inside the complex .
you're just reading me .
no . no ! it ain't you . they're inside . inside the perimeter . they're in here .
removed surgically before embryo implantation . subject marachuk , john l . died during procedure . they killed him getting it off .
poor bastard .
how long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue ?
about seventeen days .
all right . there's a fire door at this end . the first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door .
we gotta figure on them getting into the complex .
that's right . so we put up welded barricades at these intersections . . and seal these ducts here and here . then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units , here .
they're in the approach corridor .
now many ?
newt time then can walk right up and knock .
they'll get us .
maybe . maybe not .
hicks , i'm not going to wind up like those others . you'll take care of it won't you , it if comes to that ?
if it comes to that , i'll do us both . let's see that it doesn't here , i'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine .
what's this ?
well , that's the grenade launcher . you probably don't want to mess with that .
look , you started this . now show me everything . i can handle myself .
wait a minute . we'd know about it .
you know , burke , i don't know which species is worse . you don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage .
it's game time .
they learned . they cut the power and avoided the guns . they must have found another way in , something we missed .
we didn't miss anything .
locked .
stand back .
no ! no ! she's alive ! we have to
all right ! she's alive . i believe it . but we gotta get moving ! now !
hicks , don't let him leave .
we ain't going anywhere .
ellen .
save it .
let's get the fuck out of here !
not that tunnel , the other one !
well that's great ! that's just fucking great , man . now what the fuck are we supposed to do , man ? we're in some real pretty shit now !
outstanding . then all we need's a deck of cards . all right , let's move like we got a purpose .
aye firmative .
we got problems .
maybe we got 'em demoralized .
the corner ! ready ?
seventeen meters .
well you're not reading it right !
let's go ! let's go !
fuckin' a !
at ease . i'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left gateway but .
sir ?
yes , hicks ?
hudson , sir . he's hicks .
what's the question ?
is this going to be a stand up fight , sir , on another bug hunt ?
are there any questions ? hudson ?
how do i get out of this chicken shit outfit ?
. we're coming in .
sir , the cpu is on line .
okay , stand by in operations . let's go .
hah ! stop your grinnin' and drop your linen ! found 'em .
alive ?
unknown . but , it looks like all of them . over at the processing station . sublevel 'c' under the south tower .
we're not making that out too well . what is it ?
you tell me . i only work here .
how may drops is this for you , lieutenant ?
hold at forty . slow circle of the complex .
one of us ?
where are your parents ? you have to try .
gorman ! give it a rest would you .
what is it ?
i don't know .
so .
so . then the fusion containment shuts down .
so ? so ?
get them out of there ! do it now !
i told them to fall back .
how do you feel ?
all right , i guess . one hell of a hangover . look , ripley . i .
forget it .
look , we don't know what's going on out there . it may just be a down transmitter . but if it's not , i want you there . as an advisor . that's all .
you wouldn't be going in with the troops . i can guarantee your safety .
these colonial marines are some tough hombres , and they're packing state of the art firepower . nothing they can't handle . right , lieutenant ?
we're trained to deal with these kinds of situations .
still nothing from the colony ?
looks like you company can write off its share of this colony .
what's he scanning for ?
pdt's . personal data transmitters . every adult colonist had one surgically implanted .
we're talking thermonuclear explosion .
shit . apone , collect magazines from everybody . we can't have any firing in there .
fifty seven . oh , christ .
you'd drifted right through the core systems . it's blind luck that deep salvage team caught you when they . are you all right ?
have they located my daughter yet ?
well , i was going to wait until after the inquest .
is she . ?
amanda ripley mcclaren . married name , i guess . age sixty six . at time of death . two years ago . i'm sorry .
amy .
cancer . hmmmm . they still haven't licked that one . cremated . interred parkside repository , little chute , wisconsin . no children .
you read my deposition . it's complete and accurate .
look , i believe you , but there are going to be some heavyweights in there . you got feds , you got interstellar commerce commission , you got colonial administration , insurance company guys .
i get the picture .
you had them eating out of your hand , kiddo .
they had their minds made up before i even went in there . they think i'm a head case .
you are a head case . have a donut .
no . there's no way !
hear me out .
what about you ? what's your interest in this ?
well , the corporation co financed that colony with the colonial administration , against mineral rights . we're getting into a lot of terraforming . 'building better worlds . '
yeah , yeah . i saw the commercial .
i heard you were working in the cargo docks .
that's right .
running loaders , forklifts , that sort of thing ?
it's all i could get . anyway , it keeps my mind off of . everything . days off are worse .
what if i said i could get you reinstated as a flight officer ? and that the company has agreed to pick up your contract ?
if i go .
if you go . it's a second chance , kiddo . and it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it . you gotta get back on the horse .
spare me , burke . i've had my psych evaluation this month .
yes , and i've read it . you wake up every night , sheets soaking , the same nightmare over and over .
no ! the answer is no . now please go . i'm sorry . just go , would you .
yello ? oh , ripley . hi .
burke , just tell me one thing . that you're going out there to kill them . not study . not bring back . just burn them out . clean . forever .
that's the plan . my word on it .
you never said anything about an android being here ! why not ?
well , it didn't occur to me . it's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board .
i hope you're right . i really do .
i suggest you study the disks ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you .
that the atmosphere processor ?
uh hunh . one of thirty or so , all over the planet . they're completely automated . we manufacture them , by the way .
they're right under the primary heat exchangers .
yeah ? maybe the organisms like the heat , that's why they built .
that's not what i mean . gorman , if your men have to use their weapons in there , they'll rupture the cooling system .
she's right .
no good . how do we know it'll effect their biochemistry ? i say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit . it's the only way to be sure .
now hold on a second . i'm not authorizing that action .
why not ?
well , i mean . i know this is an emotional moment , but let's not make snap judgments . let's move cautiously . first , this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it
they can bill me . i got a tab running . what's second ?
this is clearly an important species we're dealing with here . we can't just arbitrarily exterminate them
you son of a bitch .
don't make me pull rank , ripley .
what rank ? i believe corporal hicks has authority here .
corporal hicks ! ?
this operation is under military jurisdiction and hicks is next in chain of command . right ?
those specimens are worth millions to the bio weapons division . now , if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes . set up for life .
you just try getting a dangerous organism past icc quarantine . section of the commerce code .
you've been doing your homework . look , they can't impound it if they don't know about it .
but they will know about it , burke . from me . just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty seven colonists here
now , wait a second
you sent them out there and you didn't even warn them , burke . why didn't you warn them ?
i expected more of you , ripley . i thought you would be smarter than this .
sorry to disappoint you .
i've isolated a neuro muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis . it seems to be metabolizing . he should wake up soon .
which would mean lots of those parasites , right ? one for each person . over a hundred at least .
yes . that follows .
but these things come from eggs . so where are all the eggs coming from .
that is the question of the hour . we could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization . an ant of termite colony , for example , is ruled by a single female , a queen , which is the source of new eggs .
you're saying one of those things lays all the eggs ?
well , the queen is always physically larger then the others . a termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all . it is fed and tended by drone workers , defended by the warriors . she is the center of their lives , quite literally the mother of their society .
could it be intelligent ?
that's it . see it ? emergency venting .
how long until it blows ?
i'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours . the blast radius will be about thirty kilometers . about equal to ten megatons .
and it's too late to shut it down ?
i'll go .
what ?
i'm really the only one qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway . believe me , i'd prefer not to . i may be synthetic but i'm not stupid .
it's going to be closer . you better get going .
see you soon .
how much time ?
plenty ! twenty six minutes !
we're not leaving !
ripley .
she's alive . they brought her here and you know it .
in seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of nebraska .
you did okay , bishop .
well , thanks , i
. that's better . pan it around a bit .
awright . fire team a . gear up . let's move . two minutes . somebody wake up hicks .
okay , let's do it .
awright ! i want a nice clean dispersal this time .
set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast . immediate dust off on my 'clear , ' then stay on station .
ten seconds , people . look sharp !
first squad up , on line . hicks , get yours in a cordon . watch the rear .
vasquez , take point . let's move .
flame units only . i want rifles slung .
let's go . pull 'em out .
uh , . apone , i want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the apc , over .
say again ? all after incinerators ?
this floor's freezing .
christ . i never saw such a buncha old women . you want me to fetch your slippers , hudson ?
whoooah ! no shit ? i'm impressed .
let's go . let's go . cycle through !
hey , 'top . ' what's the op ?
rescue mission . there's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity .
movement !
position ?
can't lock up .
talk to me , hudson .
hope their plumbing's the same .
it is .
how can i go ?
put on your wash and wear suit and your clip on tie , have your landlady tie your shoes for you , and show up at the church . simple . me and carol are going .
what ?
hey , look we've known kristin since . since she was conceived in that cabin up in big bear . remember ? you and edie banged the wall so hard , me and carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week .
goddammit , tug i want to see kristin get married , okay ? but
but you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing .
does that look at all suspicious to you ?
whatever gave you that idea ?
you got your vest ?
of course . right in the trunk of the car .
yeah , that's comforting . mine , too .
watch the driver . i'm going for a better angle on the door .
get outta there !
i can't ! do you mind !
i'll cover you ! get outta there !
yeah , sykes ?
captain . i'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective .
you are to have nothing to do with the investigation into bill tuggle's death . you know that . leave that for fedorchuk .
departmental policy .
granger and pitts are already on it .
granger and pitts have one hell of a caseload . and i would have thought with jetson here being the first newcomer plainclothes , and hubley's body being found over in the newcomer community .
don't tell me what to think .
you know i've been over all this with fedorchuk and alterez this morning .
come on . you got nothin' better to do , cushy county job like yours .
yeah , right . don't push your luck . anyway , according to the sheet , the guy you nailed outside by the car
the human ?
no i . d . on him and well , you know , no fingerprints so it could be tough . your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match .
fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets .
you took this gut out , too , didn't you ?
yeah .
lucky for you , you got him in both of his . well , what we loosely refer to as . hearts .
lucky nothing . i had to empty my damn gun into him .
oh , here's an extra headshot if you need one . we're just about to start cutting in . you're welcome to stick around if you want . it's really fascinating stuff .
you guys finished the postmortem on strader yet ?
you mean the blob ? they're finishing up now .
what kind of test ?
looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day .
jesus , are the questions too tough for you already ? let's try again is your name porter ?
ss'kya'ta' .
one of the two men was hubley , right ? what about the other one ? did you know him ?
yeah . i seen him around . high roller dude named strader . joshua strader . runs a club on the west side . encounters .
yeah , i heard of it .
that's all i know . you want anything more , you ask somebody else .
here's hubley . left quarantine on november thirtieth , relocated first to riverside , then moved to los angeles early in february the following year . field of expertise chemical manufacturing . looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery .
try joshua strader , will ya , darlin' ?
released december one . he and his wife moved first to modesto , then coalinga , california wherever that is settled in l . a . in april . field of expertise organic chemical engineering . he and his wife have one child , a son .
yeah we met him . wonderful boy . close personal friend of george's here .
i'm sorry , matt . nothing here seems to be matching up .
can you dig up their quarantine records in this thing ?
sure . just a minute .
mr . hubley was an all right guy and a damn good manager . the men liked him . i'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes .
well , one of the men didn't like him so much .
you think this is the guy who did it ?
we think he could'a been involved , yeah . you know him ?
to be honest , it's hard to say . i hate to admit it but they all still kinda look alike to me .
who else can i ask around here ?
wait . you know who it looks like ? yeah . anderson . uh . james anderson . he isn't in today . he took the afternoon off .
that where anderson worked ?
yes it is . thirty five percent pure methane gas in there . i don't know how these fellas do it .
don't piss him off , o'neal . when he gets like this , i can't control him . i've seen this before . he got like this once i saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him . nothing i could do . i hadda go throw up .
. they took the stuff out , all of it this afternoon .
you said you wanted the biggest thing i could find . well , this is it .
what is it ?
casull . magnum . you're talking twice the impact energy of . magnum hot loads .
only holds five .
yeah , the shells are too big for six in an cylinder . hell , matt , you don't need but one .
. and we work my hours . i'll do the driving , you do the paperwork . you gotta learn it so you might as well do it all .
sergeant . i'd like to thank you for what you're doing .
what's that ? look , jetson . get this straight in your head . we're not pals , we're not married , and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together . we're just partners . and don't call me sergeant . call me sykes . or matt if you have to .
i am george .
man , somebody really hung one on you ! i've heard some good ones for you guys . humphrey bogart , harley davidson . i guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while , coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you . you weren't at the back of the line , were you , george ?
my true name is ss'tangya t'ssorentsa' .
anyway , what's it matter to you if we think it's funny , right ? whatta you care ?
that is exactly so . it is like your name . sykes . i'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like ss'ai k'ss , two words in my language which mean excrement and cranium .
let's talk hubley .
his body was discovered three days ago , in an alley off of central avenue , near downtown .
with two bri sabot slugs in the chest .
through the chest . rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts .
terrific . a real pillar of the community . was hubley missing anything when they found him ? was he ripped off ?
there was no wallet . but he was still wearing a watch and two rings .
the guys at the mini mart last night made a half assed stab at the money in the till but i don't think that's what they were there for . i think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands , george .
the murder at the mini mart is not our case . the captain said
look , you want to fit in here , right ? you want to learn how to get along ?
yes .
well , there's a thing about partners , about being somebody's partner . you do for each other . and other people's rules don't mean shit . it's the rules set up between the two of you , that's all that counts . understand ? okay . well , my friend and partner was shot last night and i'm after the shitbag that did it . as my partner , i'm asking you to respect me and help me find him .
what is wrong ?
nothing's wrong . i just want to get something straight . you agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related , right ?
well . yes , quite possibly .
possibly . good . well , would you be willing to accept the theory , george , that . possibly . by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other ? does that sound unreasonable to you ?
yes . no , it is not unreasonable . although i
what's this ? what's going on ?
nothing .
nothing ?
what is this ?
get the picture ?
and that fits ?
well . yeah , it's rubber . it stretches .
newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks .
how the hell do you know that ?
a large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us . my spouse's brother is one .
so the slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like hubley worked at a refinery . i'd say that possible connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible . okay , next step i gotta go talk to the wife of the slag store owner blown away last night .
i believe i should interview the widow alone .
why the hell ? ! great , fine . you talk to the wife .
mrs . porter is not taking her husband's death well .
did you learn anything ?
a week ago two men came to see her husband . after they left , he was very frightened . she identified one of the men from a photo i showed her . it was hubley .
aw right . what about the other guy ?
she didn't know him . but she said her son might .
did you talk to him ?
he has not been home since that day . but she told me where to find him .
rudyard kipling ? no shit ? listen , we just need a minute of your time .
why did you do it ?
why'd i do what ?
agree to work with me ? you don't like me . you don't like any of us . you have nothing but contempt for us . and yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner .
who said that ?
at the end of the bar .
your name wouldn't happen to be porter , would it ?
uh , matthew .
back off , george .
but i .
i'll handle it .
screw you .
tell me .
your mother mates out of season .
that's very colorful . but see now i've got a problem . i don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you , porter . so i guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office , ya know ?
matthew , you don't have to .
you know that guy ?
from quarantine , when my people first arrived here . he and i were housed together .
how could a straight arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him ?
if i may make a suggestion . we have different weak spots than you do . next time , a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm , here , will produce the effect i think you were looking for .
i don't think i could ever learn to read that shit . how long did it take you to learn english ?
three months . we learn quickly . we adapt . it is our strength . what we were bred for , to adapt to hostile environments .
which one is that ? raw what ?
this is mole . it's good .
i'll bet . would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two ?
our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked .
so what was that other word for human . slow ka ?
ss'loka' . it means literally small but intelligent creature . it loses much in the translation .
and what was that one about my mother ? that was a good one .
ss'trokya ss'lato 'na' .
who is he ?
todd watson . the assistant manager .
we were chasing you because you ran , you dumb son of a bitch .
i believe he is probably lying .
so , she keeps you on a pretty short leash , does she ?
my wife ? she worries about me .
yeah . i know the routine .
you are married ?
was . divorced .
we mate for life . divorce . is a strange concept to us .
it's like having an eleventh finger removed . it hurts like hell , but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place .
your home is quite disordered . i thought perhaps you had been burglarized when i walked in .
i appreciate your honesty , george .
human children can be very beautiful . getting married ? congratulations . you will be taking sunday off , then .
. and so , and so the doctor says , if this is the thermometer , then where'd i leave the pen ? you're not . you don't think that's funny ? george , work with me , i always get a laugh with that one . look , if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand , then where's his pen gotta be ?
in the other man's rectum .
your health .
there is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other .
no shit , holmes . you're only from another goddamn planet , for chrissakes .
i hope you can understand how special your world is . how unique a people you humans are . so it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves .
don't count on me , george . i never had any ideals .
i'm going home .
where'd you get this ? !
she's going to divorce me .
george , she's not gonna divorce you . you mate for life , remember ?
she's very progressive . i'm certain she's considering it .
well , let's roll , george .
to the . to the beach ?
come on , let's go , dude . surf's up !
stop the car .
why ?
please , i must get out here .
come on , you won't have to get near the water .
stop the car !
it's all right , george . it's cool . just wait here , all right ? i'll be back in a coupla minutes .
what was that about ?
. so we've got three guys dead . all newcomers , all killed the same way execution style .
warren hubley was in middle management at a refinery . joshua strader operated a successful bar and nightclub .
what's this nothing shit ? it wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits , and it's not nothing now . don't lie to me , george , you're bad at it .
you must leave me alone on this .
no secrets , goddammit ! you don't hold back from me . whatever is going on , you're gonna tell me now !
no . i cannot involve you . this is not your concern .
the hell it isn't , when somebody wires up enough c explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist ! that slag was on something , and not sour milk , either ? am i right ? tell me ! what is it ?
. it is called ss'jabroka' . to us it is a potent narcotic .
how potent ?
like your cocaine , i suppose . the high lasts several hours . we would receive small amounts of it . as a reward for our labor .
we ? you've taken it ?
we all did .
where did he get it ? was there any of it on the ship ?
no . i am sure not . that is why i am so concerned . someone must now be producing it here . but none of my people know how to make it . the process was carefully guarded .
jesus , this is major . why didn't you tell me sooner ? why'd you hold out on me ?
your people don't know about this part of out past . and they can't know it would threaten our entire existence here .
george . look me in the eye . george , you don't ever lie to me again .
they had months in quarantine to develop the plan . porter , with his chemistry background , must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug . hubley manufactured it at the refinery . strader , through the nightclub , established a distribution network . and harcourt
okay , george we gotta play this real smart .
if the drug is here , we must destroy it .
uh , george .
where is the drug ? where have they taken it ?
george , uh . you're gonna break his little chest bones .
stay out of this , matthew . tell me where the drug has been taken or i will crush your lungs against this wall .
george , c'mon lighten up . it's a beauty of a case . don't sweat it we got him by the short hairs . he ain't gonna make any more of the shit .
the fifty kilos , matthew . i have to find it . i can't let it get out on the street .
fuck procedure .
shit !
with harcourt and kipling dead , i assume you will be requesting reassignment now .
what's this about , george ? i know that look .
no ! we must do this alone .
what is this ? !
. it's harcourt .
harcourt is dead .
no he's not . not if he overdosed on the drug . massive amounts trigger a . a change . your body functions seize up , you appear to be dead , but it's really a state of incubation . when you emerge you're .
i never thought i'd say this , but for once in my life i think i'm willing to wait for back up .
we can't let him get away .
why the hell are you so dead set against back up ?
because . because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming .
but there's no more drug .
you understand that . but how many others will ?
how do i look ?
you look very good .
that cop , the human , he was the one who killed anderson and the driver .
this is becoming a serious breach of security .
he didn't recognize me .
it is his new partner that i'm worried about .
when we picked him up , he was talking to those two cops the two who came to question you about hubley .
kill them both .
here ?
do it !
william harcourt ?
yes .
i'm sergeant sykes , and this is detective jetson , los angeles police department .
yes , i heard about poor warren . tragic .
you were partners with him on some slag uh , newcomer real estate thing .
that's right . he and i , along with seven or eight others . listen , gentlemen , i will be happy to assist you in any way i can unfortunately , at the moment , i'm overdue at another function .
move a finger , harcourt , and you're history .
no , sergeant not history . eternity .
so what've you got on tuggle's killers ?
jesus , sykes it's been less than ten hours . me and alterez are on it , okay ?
you don't have squat .
look at your dildo partner . he's too scared to even come down to the sand . you're not gonna get wet standing here , moron !
i'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid , fedorchuk . see how much surfin' you'd do .
well , if it isn't detective jetson . forget you hip waders , big guy ?
lay off , asshole .
i may be an asshole , but at least i'm a real detective , not some outer shit space thing .
you are cassandra ?
that's right .
we are with the police department . this is sergeant sykes , and i am
he's not here . why ask me ?
the young woman at the front said you might know where he is .
in there .
show me .
oooh . hardball . that sounds interesting . are you going to strike me ? you could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me . i've got my own ropes .
does that cost extra or you throw them in ?
look , i don't know where mr . strader might be . he comes and he goes .
the girl out front mentioned strader's assistant , somebody named watson . maybe he knows .
i know . why don't you hang around for a while , let me entertain you ? it's matt , right ? now tell me the truth , have you ever . made it . with one of us ?
not unless i got real drunk and nobody told me about it later .
a virgin . i find that very arousing .
there's lots of things i haven't done , but his ain't high on the list . don't take it personally .
i think you're just a little scared now , about what you might find once the lights go out . a little scared . and a lot curious . maybe more than you want to admit . but doesn't that turn you on , that curiosity and fear , swirling together ? think of it as broadening your horizons .
i like my horizons narrow .
your voice is saying no , but your body is saying yes .
you okay ?
fourteen b . it's halfway down on your right .
thank you .
do you feel all right , sir ?
oh i haven't flown for a long time .
excuse me , sir . would you like some coffee before we serve dinner ?
no . no thank you .
excuse me , sir . there's been a little problem in the cockpit and i was wondering .
the cockpit ? what is it ?
it's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit . but that's not important right now . the first officer is ill and the captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio . do you know anything about planes ?
well , i flew in the war , but that was a long time ago . i wouldn't know anything about it .
mr . striker , the passengers are ready .
thank you , randy . you better leave sweetheart . you might get hurt in here .
excuse me , sister ?
yes ?
there's a little girl on board who's ill and .
oh yes , i saw . poor child .
could i borrow your guitar ? i thought i might be able to cheer her up .
of course .
sorry , clarence . latest weather report shows everything socked in from salt lake to lincoln .
roger .
huh ?
roger .
we have clearance , clarence .
roger , roger . what's our vector , victor ?
do you want me to check the weather , clarence ?
no , he's not bothering anyone . let him stay up here .
all right . but just remember , my name is roger murdock .
would either of you like another cup of coffee ?
i will , but jim won't .
yes ?
oh , stewardess . my husband is very sick . can you do something , please ?
well , the doctor will be with you in just a moment . one thing do you know what he had for dinner ?
yes , of course . we both had fish . why ?
oh , it's nothing to be alarmed about . we'll get back to you very quickly .
hi !
i'm randy .
i'm lisa . oh , you have a guitar !
i thought maybe you'd like to hear a song .
oh , i'd love to .
okay , this is one of my favorites .
wait a minute . i know you . you're kareem abdul jabbar . you play basketball for the los angeles lakers !
i'm sorry , son , but you must have me confused with someone else . my name is roger murdock . i'm the co pilot .
you u are u kareem . i've seen you play . my dad's got season tickets !
i'm an airline pilot . ah , clarence , according to my calculations , with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the rockies .
i think you're the greatest . but my dad says you don't work hard enough on defense .
denver control , this is flight two zero niner intersecting victor airway seven niner niner .
. and that lots of times you don't even run down court .
we are turning left to a heading of zero niner niner .
. and that you don't really try , except during the playoffs .
the hell i don't ! i'm out there busting my buns every night .
jack , isn't that fred bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck ? maybe he's on our flight to chicago .
what did you think of 'great expectations ? '
oh , i can't stand it .
how ya doing , honey ?
oh jack , i'm so warm . i'm burning up .
here .
and get that finger out of your ear . you don't know where that finger's been ! gunderson ?
yes , captain ?
did you decide on a runway yet ?
eight miles . turn right to heading zero eight niner .
you are now eight miles from the airport . turn right to a heading of zero eight niner , throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet .
he's all over the place ! nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet ! what an asshole !
watch your altitude , striker . it's too erratic . you can't come straight in . you've got enough fuel left for two hours flying . you've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather .
he's right on the heading .
all right , he's on final now ! put out all runway lights except niner .
oh , bill , i'm going to miss you so much .
you promise you'll write .
every day .
good bye , darling .
oh , bill , i'll keep it . i'll keep it with me all the time .
so long , darling . good bye . take care of yourself .
bill ! bill ! good bye , bill .
good bye , darling .
good bye , darling . i love you . i love you , darling .
good bye , darling .
we have a visitor .
hello .
we'd better get back now .
hey , we've been waiting for you . a little bit late tonight .
who wants to be first ?
airsick ?
i think so , but i've never seen it so acute .
find out if there's a doctor on board , as quietly as you can .
elaine !
ted !
i came home early and found your note . i guess you meant for me to read it later . elaine , i've got to talk to you .
i just don't want to go over it any more .
i know things haven't been right for a long time , but it'll be different . if you'll just be patient , i can work things out .
i have been patient and i've tried to help , but you wouldn't even let me do that .
don't you feel anything for me at all any more ?
it takes so many things to make love last . most of all it takes respect . and i can't live with a man i don't respect !
look , you'll be back in town tomorrow night . we'll have dinner talk it over .
i won't be back . i've requested the atlanta run .
elaine , not yet . i promise you i really can change .
then why don't you take the job that louie netz offered you at boeing ?
you know i haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war . and even if i could , they wouldn't hire me because of my war record .
your u war u u record u ? you're the only one keeping that alive . for everyone else it's ancient history .
you expect me to believe that ?
it's the truth . what's hurt you the most is your record since the war . different cities , different jobs , and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility .
but if you'll just give me .
ted , what are you doing here ?
elaine , i've got to talk to you .
what's the matter ?
my orders came through . my squadron ships out tomorrow . i'll be leading a very important mission .
oh , ted , please be careful . i worry about you so much .
i love you , elaine .
i love you .
elaine , just hear me out . i know things haven't been right for a long time . but it will be different . like it was in the beginning . remember ?
mostly i remember . the nights when we were together . i remember how you used to hold me . and how i used to sit on your face and wriggle . and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up . when it did , it was almost like . like each new day was created . only for us .
that's the way i've always wanted it to be , elaine .
you got a telegram from headquarters today .
headquarters ! ? what is it ?
it's a big building where the generals meet . but that's not important right now . they've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid . isn't that good news ?
is it ? because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid .
seven . lieutenant zipp died this morning . ted , doctor sandler says you'll be out in a week . isn't that wonderful ?
i wish i could say the same for george zipp .
what's his problem ?
i think they're getting the hang of it ! when we re enlist i'll teach them baseball !
ted , i don't want to stay here . it's time for us to go back home to the plans we made before the war .
a lot of people made plans before the war . like george zipp .
ted ! what are you doing ? you can't fly this plane !
that's what i've been trying to tell these people .
rain .
and a little ice .
and a little ice !
sluggish . like a wet sponge .
sluggish . like a wet sponge .
it's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much i hate his guts .
it's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts .
rats ! i've lost number three .
what happened , ted ? what went wrong ?
oil pressure . i forgot to check the oil pressure . when kramer hears about this , the shit's gonna hit the fan .
but ted , you're the only .
i don't care . i just don't have what it takes . they'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before .
ted .
yes ?
i wanted you to know now i'm very proud .
tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land .
the gear is down .
see them , elaine ?
sir . excuse me , sir . i'm sorry to have to wake you . are you a doctor ?
that's right .
we have some passengers who are very sick . could you come and take a look at them ?
you'd better tell the captain . we've got to land as soon as we can . this woman has to be gotten to a hospital .
a hospital ? what is it ?
it's a big building with patients . but that's not important right now . tell the captain i must speak to him .
certainly .
what was it we had for dinner tonight ?
well , we had a choice . steak or fish .
what did he have ?
doctor rumack , mister hammen ate fish . and randy says there are five more cases , and they ate fish , too .
let's see now . the co pilot had fish . what did the navigator eat ?
just how serious is it , doctor ?
elaine , you're a member of this crew . can you face some unpleasant facts ?
no .
all right . unless i can get all these people to a hospital quickly , i can't even be sure of saving their lives . now , is there anyone else on board who can land this plane ?
no . no one that i know of .
captain , how soon can we land ?
i can't tell .
can't you take a guess ?
well . not for another two hours .
you can't take a guess for another two hours ?
what is it , doctor ? what's happening ?
i'm not sure . i haven't seen anything like this since the lina wertmuller film festival .
both pilots !
can you fly this airplane and land it ?
surely you can't be serious .
i u am u serious , and don't call me shirley ! what flying experience have you had ?
well , i flew single engine fighters in the air force , but this plane has four engines . it's an entirely different kind of flying . u all u u together u !
elaine , i haven't time to put this gently , so i'll be very direct . everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation . mister striker is the only hope we've got .
let's see . those are the flaps , that's the thrust , this must turn on the landing lights .
. safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment .
chicago , the passengers are beginning to panic . when do we start down ?
will the hospital equipment be at the airport ?
yes , everything they've got . how are the passengers doing ?
i won't deceive you , mister striker . we're running out of time .
surely there must be something you can do .
i'm doing everything i can ! and stop calling me shirley !
george zipp said that ?
and the last thing he said to me , doc , he said , sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys , tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the zipper . i don't know where i'll be then , doc , he said , but i won't smell too good . that's for sure .
excuse me , doc , i've got a plane to land .
hello , i'm paul carey from the airline . i'm here to pick up captain kramer .
shep , sit . sit ! so , i understand you've got a real emergency down there .
well , to tell the truth , they really didn't fill me in on many of the details . just told me to pick up captain kramer .
something about a plane with no pilot ?
yeah , something like that , but as i say , they didn't have time to tell me very much .
shep , no ! i'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there .
. but after . awhile . you begin to . . get used to it .
shep , no ! he gets so excited when new people are here .
i happened to be passing , and i thought you might like some corfee .
ah , won't you sit down ?
thank you . cream ?
no , thank you . i take it black . like my men .
were you vacationing in los angeles ?
well , it really wasn't a vacation . you see , i'm a teacher in the new york city school system , and i was attending a seminar on visual aids to education . are you from l . a . ?
after my wife died , i felt like a fifth wheel . you know , so many years being with one person a very wonderful person makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair . when ethel passed away , i was lost . i couldn't function socially and i couldn't function in business .
well , after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to .
but i think it's time we stopped talking about me . a woman like you why haven't you ever married ?
well , i'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer .
i know the answer career . a smart woman like you became so involved in your work , you didn't have time for marriage .
i wish i could fool myself into believing that that's the reason . the truth of the matter is , nobody ever asked me .
you know , here we are having coffee together , and discussing education and business and economy . and we don't even know each other's names . full names i mean .
mine's eleanor . eleanor schiff .
i'm sure we'll both make it . but just in case one of us . well , is there a message you'd like me to give someone ?
no . i'm all alone .
just in case i don't have a chance to say goodbye , i want you to know that i haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years .
excuse me , are you alright ? i noticed you talking to yourself . i'm a nurse . can i be of some help ?
uh . oh , thank you . it's nothing .
you don't have to thank me , i'm a nurse . this is my father , dr . barrington .
not dr . barrington , the world renowned agronomist ?
yes . he's dying u a n d u wants to be buried on mercury .
i'm familiar with your work , doctor . you'll have to excuse me , i have to go .
you've been hurt .
i'm getting over it . if a relationship isn't working , you can't force it .
do you want to talk about it .
i opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me .
no . i mean your relationship .
we were in love but i'm not sure i know what love is anymore .
love's the same as it always was . it's people who change .
people change in relation to each other . love changes on its own .
not if the people change together in relation to that love .
sure . but that's only when the love itself goes unchanged .
then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love .
i just wish it was that simple . we really were in love . you know how it is when you laugh all the time .
no . it's hard to l a u g h when your father's dying .
are you on the mercury mission ?
you're seeing bugs where they don't exist , striker .
look at this wiring . it's shorting out under high temperatures .
you're tired , striker , overworked . that wiring meets all the safety specifications .
i know you've been subtly spreading the word that i'm having a breakdown .
striker .
kurtz , you're drunk . who's in command of this ship ?
that damn computer has taken over . i'm getting out .
then elaine was right .
don't talk to me about elaine . outta my way !
i have to see bud kruger .
do you have an appointment , sir ?
no , dammit . it's a matter of life or death .
you'll have to be more specific than that , sir .
all right , it's a matter of death .
you can't go in there !
don't try to stop me !
but that's not a door . the door's over there .
you folks need any help ?
thanks , but we have a terrific woman in on thursdays .
say , isn't that dr . barrington , the world renowned agronomist ?
yes .
it's a privilege to meet you , sir , i'm familiar with all your work .
let's go , daddy . we have to check in . he was never appreciated at the institute .
ah , yes , the institute , i'm familiar with it .
now he's d y i n ging and wants to be buried on mercury .
captain oveur ?
mr . kurtz , i presume .
that's how dry cleaning works . now i'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians .
good to be aboard , gentlemen .
whenever your're ready , captain .
yes , sir , commander . this is mercury one . everything seems a okay up here and ready for count down .
which passenger is joe salucci ?
sixteen 'c' , why ?
he's carrying a bomb .
a b .
no , a bomb . now , as discreetly as possible , i want you to move the passengers into the lounge .
what should i say ?
anything . just don't let salucci think we're onto him .
a couple eggs and juice would be nice , mary . over .
how would you like your eggs , captain ? over .
no . poached . over .
poached u and u over , captain oveur ? over .
that's how i want them . poached . over .
all right , captain oveur . over .
poached ! not over ! over !
captain , the coffee machine is jammed and i don't like it .
have you tried it with a little cinnamon ?
joe , you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people .
i don't want to live anymore .
joe , the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids . you bought auto insurance , not life insurance .
what ?
that's right , joe . now , no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you .
you're sure ?
i'm sure .
take this , joey . it's my last few bucks . you'll need a hot meal when you get there .
we've spent everything on these operations . is it really worth it ? we've pawned your mother's wedding ring . the kids have no winter clothes .
joey , what's more important , the kids' clothes or your sexual potency .
i don't want to hear that word !
okay , joey . the doc says you gotta relax . this hospital in des moines is the best sex clinic in the country .
all right . here .
what . ?
come on up , jimmy . say , that's some puppy . what's his name ?
scraps .
can i hold him ?
sure .
he's a boy dog .
yeah .
do you like it when scraps sleeps on his back , jimmy ?
will scraps be able to sit with us , dad ?
we'll have to check , jimmy . it's a pretty long trip to mercury .
i sure an glad they let scraps ride up here with us .
i bet scraps is going to love mercury .
do you think things will be a lot different on mercury , dad ?
how many kids get a chance to live on another planet .
no more kids yelling , 'your old man's a thieving rapist' ?
look , a man can make an honest mistake ! anyway , she was asking for it ! they're all asking for it all the time !
intermitant failure in scan mode r . analyze .
negative .
that doesn't make sense . repeat analysis .
negative .
that's not possible .
elaine , i'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago .
that's okay , rok .
can i say something of a personal nature to you ?
go ahead .
you have great tits .
request comprehensive electrical systems check .
systems check positive . look , elaine , i .
request life support systems check .
life support check . elaine , it's obvious you've been ignoring me . you're a woman . i can relate to that .
request self analysis of rok hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes .
there's nothing wrong with me , elaine . what about tonight just you and me . we can be alone . i can get rid of everyone else on the ship i've already proven u that u .
elaine , ask rok for a field interference scan . those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications .
i don't think we have any alternative , captain .
i see . what do you think our alternatives are ?
we have to disconnect rok's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system .
roger .
you can do it from up here , captain .
i'd rather sit down for this one , elaine .
no , i mean you can do it from the cockpit .
roger . you better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit .
for the best little computer officer on the mercury mission .
simon .
who would believe that elaine thompson was once a stewardess on the denver chicago run .
and i can hardly believe that i'm engaged to someone like you , simon . i'm a very lucky woman .
women u and u the space program have come a long way , sweetheart . but after the wedding , no more complicated computers for my little girl .
but , darling , they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the jupiter probe .
frank's the best pilot in the program .
i'm so excited , simon .
i guess this is a first for you .
no , i've been excited before .
elaine ! ted's a danger to himself , he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the middle east .
simon , why has he become so . so .
meet me onboard , sweetheart . i have to pick up a few things at the drugstore .
don't be too long .
have you got it straightened out now ?
i think so .
that's my girl .
simon , i'm going to check rok's secondary readout unit .
roger .
simon , what's happening ? !
he tried to disconnect rok . it gassed him . that computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun .
can't we change course ?
my career is shot .
simon , i didn't want it to end like this . we can be friends ! you'll die out there .
maybe .
ted seemed to get worse after i told him about simon , doctor .
so you see , our task isn't made any easier by ted's refusal to admit that he's sick .
what can u i u do , doctor rumack ?
you can eat balanced meals , exercise , and take geritol .
i mean for ted .
you can be gentle with him , elaine . he's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden .
is that a good sign , doctor ?
the brain is an amazingly complex organ , elaine .
is he making any progress , doctor ?
yes last week that pile of mud was only this high .
elaine .
te . !
it's got to be stopped !
but , ted , the invitations have already gone out .
i mean the mercury flight . it's not safe and , kurtz , you know why .
ted , what's wrong ?
ask simon .
ted , you're overworked . you've been flying yourself into the ground .
there's nothing wrong with me !
let's relax tonight , just the two of us . i'll make a quiet italian dinner just the way you like it , with spaghetti .
elaine .
ted , please . you're just making things difficult for yourself .
elaine , what happened to us ?
who's that , ted ?
elaine , when are you going to realize simon kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way .
and when are you going to realize , ted , that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now .
his name's david stockman . he's been here twenty years , that's all he says .
ted , you must remember what the doctor said , the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick . now take your electro shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time . and by the way , ted , i'm leaving you for simon .
no goodbyes , elaine . just go .
if that's the way you want it .
that's the way i want it . just turn the radio on and go .
ted ! what are you . ?
i have to get in there . i have to stop this flight .
ted , we're taking off !
let me by , elaine .
what are you doing , ted ?
i've got it , elaine ! i've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle !
ted .
not now , elaine !
ted !
elaine .
ted . i don't know why you got on this flight . i don't know what you're trying to prove .
elaine , we have to go back .
we can't go back . we had something very special , but it's all over .
elaine , i mean the mission has to be aborted . this ship should never have passed fsa inspection . this thing is held together by string and chewing gum .
ted , get a grip on yourself . you should never have left the hospital .
then you u do u think i'm insane .
i've never used the word insane , ted .
what word would you use , elaine ?
the word is sick . ted very , very , very sick .
what would you say if i told you the toilet just blew up in my face .
i'd use the word insane .
there's something dangerously wrong with this ship , elaine . i know its the wiring . that toilet's just the tip of the iceberg .
ted , a toilet's not going to kill anyone .
elaine !
ted !
elaine , what's going on ?
ted , there's no time to explain .
elaine , i'm going back there . just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can .
ted , we've only got ten minutes .
not now , elaine .
i mean until we start to burn up .
kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place . you people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly . you played god with over a hundred lives , kruger , and for what the prestige of your precious space program .
that was very well put , ted .
well , elaine , this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something .
i just want you to know , i love you ted and always will .
that might be the news we've been waiting for .
simon just ejected !
sit down , elaine . if this bomb trick works we just might make it . simon was a fool to eject now .
you mean .
that's right premature ejection .
what will happen to him , ted ?
are you afraid ?
not when i'm with you , ted .
we've blown the computer ! elaine ! set course change !
set !
now !
ted , the lever !
kramer , the worp control handle just came off in my hand .
oveur .
shut down accelerators .
we seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four , sir .
you better check it , unger .
sir , i've got an overload in disposal unit four .
dunn .
sir ?
you better take this .
did you feel that ?
yes i did .
felt like a large asteroid .
yes it did . mr . dunn , can i ask you a personal question ?
what is it , mary ?
um . do you people scream right when you . you know .
commissioner , we both know the mercury shuttle needs another month of pre launch testing .
forget it . the boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule .
and what do the boys on the board know about safety , commissioner ? let u me u talk to them .
you handle your front office people , i'll handle the press and leave the boys in washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board .
commissioner .
what ?
that's right , commissioner . senselessly murdered just minutes ago .
that just doesn't make any sense .
i wonder how your boys in washington are going to take this one .
i told you , leave the boys in washington to the boys downtown and the boys down .
forget it . i was reading .
i was reading too .
what's the story ?
some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor .
kruger , sagittarius .
cbs said they'll give us four minutes . they thought the russian was a nice touch .
i always wondered if my freshman russian class would come in handy .
you wanna knock of f ?
no , no . i'm fine . what did the speaker say ?
with all due respect , sir , maybe you should give them this one . your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail stravanavitch .
i might still have a few chips left .
we could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge . the second amendment types'll love that .
this is a crime bill , shep . killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee . besides , shep , i told you . i don't shoot babies and i don't kiss guns .
other way around , sir .
it's bait . don't take it .
sir , the speaker of the house attacked this administration on national television . you can't afford to leave that hanging .
i said it's not worth the fight . steward , please .
you give me ulcers .
defense and state department in the conference room in one hour . i want to review the iraq situation .
mr . president . they're ready for you in the conference room .
okay . hey , pumpkin , you'll tell me all about it later , right ?
mr . president , how the hell did you get on board ?
shepherd .
sir .
my god . i think that was a mig .
iraq , sir . we're over iraq .
shit .
how long's it been since you flew , sir ?
twenty five years .
twenty five minutes . they should be here any moment .
they better . fuel's almost gone .
it's open !
do you see teem ?
we're hooked !
we're hooked . hove into position .
white house switchboard . how may i direct your call .
okay listen , listen carefully . this is an emergency call from air force one . who's there ? is the vice president there ?
who can i say is calling ?
this is the president .
yeah , right .
don't cut me off . this is an emergency .
sir , the president does not call this particular number . so whoever you are get a life , before i have this call traced .
you don't understand . this is an emergency . let me talk to anyone .
okay . if you're the president , when's your wife's birthday ?
look lady , i don't have time for games . just put the .
thank you for calling the white house .
what's going on ?
we're under attack .
where's my family ?
one .
but .
two . three . go !
did they say anything about my family ?
they're still alive , but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes .
then tell me there's a rescue operation underway .
and if that means negotiating .
you know my policy . we don't negotiate with terrorists . if we start now , all of america becomes a target .
please , mr . president . you're going to get yourself killed . is that your solution ?
freeing stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed . i can't live with that . i'm not royalty . i'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the president is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office . we don't negotitate . not as long as i'm president . is that understood ?
the fax machines .
excuse me ?
the fax machines .
no good . i said they disabled the communications system .
where are we sending it ?
someone should give you a raise .
actually , sir , you could be that someone .
may i speak to you for a moment ?
can't it wait ?
don't . i know spin control when i feel it .
rose , i don't have time for this .
for godsakes , jim , slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy . not even you can plug all the world's leaks . don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on mtv news than in person .
she's a big girl . she understands .
how do you know she understands ? you haven't spent more than five minutes with her , or me , in weeks .
you know what ?
what ?
i miss you . and i miss her .
but that's the point , jim . we're right here .
i'll make it up to you , i promise .
i should trust that promise ? because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut .
this promise isn't subject to congressional approval .
how did your speech go ?
look on the bright side , hon . shep here thinks i'll be a one termer .
i don't know why you stayed .
call petrov . i'll be back .
what are you doing ?
flying the plane .
you haven't even driven a car since you took office .
our kh ll's took this one at hours . what you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades .
they've gotta be joking .
the northern border's gotten a bit hairy . their migs are playing tag with our tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage .
mr . caidwell , the ground's a few miles away . how do you propose getting us from here to there ?
gravity .
we've already played our cards , major . there's no turning back .
we can't jump from here or at this speed . but if we could get a message out tell the refueling plane .
get em ready . you . come with me .
eighteen thousand feet , sir . and two hundred knots . otherwise it's suicide .
i'll not going without my family .
sir , we stay with the president .
that isn't necessary .
our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground . our hands are completely tied while they're in the air .
okay , gentlemen , we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane . lee , go huddle with the d . o . d . i want an options paper on this in minutes .
twenty minutes ?
you heard me . you . congress and cabinet heads .
madame vice president . we have an options paper . chandler takes the options paper , waves off lee , and reads it as she talks .
yes . you've made yourself quite clear .
finally , we can bargain .
i'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement . land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel .
now since we've had very little luck getting washington or moscow to cooperate , i wondered if you would be so kind .
over my dead body .
no . but since i only have a few of your staff left to kill , perhaps i will start with your family instead . gibbs .
she isn't a part of this . this is between you and me .
call up petrov and order stravanavitch' s release .
this administration does not negotiate with terrorists .
pity . mr . gibbs .
stop .
you'll do it ?
yes , i'll do it . just leave my family alone .
good . good .
someday , you'll regret my nature .
the taste of defeat is bitter , no ?
one thing i've learned as
there goes your ride .
let my daughter go or i'll take you out !
no you won't . you'll compromise . like always .
hold on , alice .
fear will keep you alive . any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish , and bound to die .
what do you want with us ?
now , or he dies , please .
leave my daughter alone .
or you will do what , mrs . marshall ? but i admire your courage . your husband , on the other hand .
what do you know of my husband ?
i know he left you behind .
my husband is a very courageous man .
your husband is a coward . he sends soldiers half way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night .
do you have to be so brutal ?
yes
why ? do you enjoy it ?
i neither enjoy nor dislike . i do what is necessary .
how can you ? i mean they're people .
but they are not ny people . you look at me as if i am a monster , but answer me this when your planes bombed the oil fields of iraq , did you cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces you will never see ? did you cry for their wives and children . they were people too , yes . but they were not your people .
that was war .
shall i begin by executing the president's daughter ? she's right here .
no .
say something dear .
nor will there be . my husband does not negotiate with terrorists .
the world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children .
please . you can kill me but leave my daughter alone .
four .
jim .
three .
you got what you wanted . you going to release us now ?
ms . mitchell . so nice to finally meet you in person .
up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the mission communication center . the mcc , as we call it , can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth . we're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations . we could run the country or run a war from there if we had to .
this is a remarkable aircraft .
you don't know the half of it . did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation ? we could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary .
a dubious distinction , no ?
i guess it depends on your perspective .
and all these rooms here ?
here's a press kit . i'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne i'll be able to schedule the interviews .
please tell me your name .
maria . maria mitchell .
and what is it you do , ms . mitchell .
i'm responsible for press relations for the flight office .
how are your fellow hostages feeling , ms . mitchell ?
you're pointing a gun at me .
very good . thank you , ms . mitchell .
tower , air force one has been boarded .
romeo tango zulu , do you have the president ? over .
stand by .
romeo tango zulu this is tower .
we copy . stand by . tower ?
tower , here .
this is romeo tango zulu changing call signs . tower , alert air traffic , romeo tango zulu is now air force one . this is air force one . the president is safe onboard .
copy , air force one .
we've already been inspected .
sir , this plane carries the president of the united states .
the rest of the secret service ?
dead .
how many others killed ?
nine .
who did this ?
we checked the manifest . everyone was accounted for .
remarkable aircraft . remarkable .
why did they do that ?
psychology . they're trying to unnerve us .
well it worked .
how ?
avionics compartment ! it's the only place . you better get zedeck down there fast unless , of course , you'd rather be a martyr than a savior .
go ! take serge . and watch your backs .
we've stopped dumping . but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left .
we're not going to make it .
not even close . hell , we can't even make syria or iraq .
where are we now ?
over the black sea . i can probably get us to turkey or georgia .
no ! if we land this plane anywhere else , we will end up another entebe . the americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud , evades missiles and . refuels in mid air . call the white house .
air force one , this is af ra . we have been instructed to refuel your plane .
about goddamn time .
please change course to zero seven four and drop to eighteen thousand feet . over .
air force one , acknowledged . tnt . emergency parachute launch ramp .
air force one , please reduce speed to knots .
that's affirmative .
ga get it .
special agent gibbs . you helped do this ?
yes , mr . president .
why ?
because it is my duty .
you're duty to what ? the country you served doesn't exist anymore .
my loyalty was never to my country .
general greely says it looks like the middle east .
can we do that ?
we've got four hours before they make it into turkienistan airspace .
but they start executing hostages in
i hate to be pragmatic , but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings . it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff .
they still have the president , it's past their deadline and they haven't called . what do you think it means ?
like any good poker player , they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard .
if challenged , our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission .
iraqi's won't buy it . either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying .
the chief justice ? what on earth for ?
to swear you in as president .
sir , you threw out page two .
goddamn right i did . i asked for a tough as nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit . what's the point in having a speech if i have to ad lib ?
it was a good ad lib , sir .
thanks . wrote it last night .
apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be . representative taylor is working on a compromise .
put together a score sheet . i'll make some calls .
the iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise .
an exercise in futility . send the nimitz back in .
he's dead then . they must have killed him .
we don't know that .
walter , if you have a point , make it .
that kid's name was jim marshall .
they aren't answering their hails .
this doesn't make sense .
they've got no chutes . they can't control the plane , their engines are failing and they're losing fuel .
i prefered the terrorists .
that's game , set , and match . there's nothing to do , except call the chief justice .
u . s . pilots , this is air force one .
mr . president , it's an honor . now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here .
you read my mind .
put your pilot on .
he's busy being dead .
who's flying the fucking plane ?
i'm doing what i can .
okay . we're gonna arc a fat one to the right . got it ?
got it .
stay cool .
how we doing , colonel ?
we still got three migs running around and six more on the way .
uh , we got a problem here .
just stay on my wing , sir . i'll take you all the way in .
no . we're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding .
aw , man . you're torn up pretty bad out here , sir . do you have any elevater control .
sluggish . i think it's jammed too .
uh , tower , we got a problem up here .
do you see the maintenance panel ?
got it .
pop it open . there should be a red switch , toggle it up .
okay , it's on . we've got some indicator lights here .
okay , you're aerated . to dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump . there's no switch in avionics so you'll have to cross the wires . there should be five wires , just to your left . do you see them ?
it's cut .
cross it . the static overwhelms the voice , then cuts out .
the americans say they are escorting a damaged plane . our pilots confirm they are surrounding a .
did we warn them off ?
yes . they refused to alter course and the would not answer our hails .
it's some kind of trick . a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement .
they are in our airspace . we would be within our rights .
the world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner .
the pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet .
warn then again . if they don't respond . shoot them down . we will not be intimidated .
oooooh , i'm good .
how was . . the ballet ?
it was the experience of a lifetime .
alice !
daddy .
how you doing , sweetie ?
oh ny god . oh my god . oh my god .
it's okay , honey . i got you . i got you . you're okay .
there they are !
okay , i'm slowing us down .
i don't drink coffee .
you must be tired . it'll wake you up .
you're one of stravanavitch's men .
so , you study world events , little one . that's good for a girl your age .
yeah , i study world events . five thousand turkienistan muslims were slaughtered in stravanvitch's cleansings . along with american school kids . you know hqw i studied that . i went to their funerals with my dad . i met their parents .
smart for your age , eh ? top of your class ? tell me , do you know what the word quot propaganda quot means ?
the woman you shot . she was my friend .
that's the way of the world , little one . didn't they teach you that in school ?
fuck off , you stupid asshole .
it would be a pity to squander such a strong personality .
he didn't leave us .
you are a resilient man , mr .
it's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times .
well , you aren't the president , dear .
yeah , no duh .
you don't want to say hi to your father ?
i'm sure he's busy .
don't you even want to ask ?
hey joey , how bout a cocoa , double whip cream .
alice .
mom , just this once , give it a rest .
you're jet lagged . we'll talk about this back .
back at the fishbowl ?
we'll talk at home . you know , most girls aren't as lucky as you . for most girls seeing the bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime .
he's in a meeting . he can't be disturbed .
i'm sorry , honey .
when i write my memoirs i think i'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard air force one .
your father never means to be so .
i know . but lotsa times i feel like it's me versus the world . some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in bangladesh . i mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important .
some kids were teasing you ?
that's not really the point .
you're right and i'll tell you a secret . i know exactly how you feel .
mom ?
yes dear ?
daddy . daddy , please .
rolfe .
wade ?
yeah , brother , look , i was calling cause has there been anything on tv in boston about a hunting accident with a guy named twombley , evan twombley ?
there was something . it happened up your way .
yeah , i know him the kid that was with him . maybe you do too . jack hewitt . he works for lariviere with me . he's my best friend .
wade , it's late . i know you're probably at toby's , but i'm in bed reading . we got different habits .
it'll come out jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it .
he was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in new england and the construction business .
who ?
twombley .
no shit .
you think jack shot him ?
well , it was an accident .
they were out deer hunting , right ? jack probably heard the gun go off , then came back and found the body .
lillian was here . in lawford .
huh ?
the night before the shooting .
how was she ?
picked up jill . she was supposed to visit for the weekend for halloween . she wanted to go home .
who ?
jill . i was thinking of getting a lawyer . maybe you can help me .
what happened ?
a divorce lawyer . a custody lawyer . you know , 'cause of jill .
don't think about it . you're exhausted .
yeah , i guess .
get some sleep .
i get to feeling like a whipped dog some days , rolfe , and some night i'm going to bite back . i swear it .
haven't you already done a bit of that ?
pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do , i guess .
what about jill ? is lillian bringing her ?
anyone else want one ? rolfe ?
no thanks . i don't drink .
yeah . i forgot .
what about margie ?
what about her ?
well , do you still plan to get married ?
i want to let the gas run out . i don't want the bastard driving drunk , and he's always drunk now . after , we'll hide the keys .
anything new about the shooting ? twombley ?
i guess it was an accident , like everybody thinks .
want to know what i think happened ?
find them everywhere .
i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one .
which is ?
that it wasn't an accident .
then who shot him ?
well , your friend , i think . jack hewitt .
motive . you gotta have a motive .
money .
who'd pay him that kind of money ? not the mob . they got their own guys . specialists .
they wouldn't deal with a guy like jack . who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead ?
i don't know . you tell me .
okay . it's likely there are people in the union who don't want twombley to testify . they probably include his son in law who's vice president and will probably be the next president . i read that in the papers . what's his name , mel gordon ?
yeah , the guy with the bmw i told you about . i did , didn't i ?
here's my theory . twombley , unaware of illegal union loans or whatever , starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out . finds out his son in law is involved .
so mel gordon wouldn't want a professional hit . that'd make the feds dig deeper . he wants an accident .
a hunting accident is perfect .
it's too neat . things ain't that neat . it makes me mad . that somebody can pay to kill somebody , his own father in law , and not be punished for it . don't that piss you off ?
not particularly .
right's right , goddamnit ! don't you care what's right ?
i was thinking about that story you told me , about pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after .
yeah .
i hate to disappoint you , but i don't think it happened .
of course it happened . why would i lie about it ?
it may have happened , but not the way you said .
you think i wouldn't remember a thing like that ?
it wasn't me . i wasn't there , but i heard about it . when i heard about it , it was about elbourne .
we'd have to go digging in vietnam to ask him .
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft .
