well , i never heard that one .
i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop . i was a careful child and i became a careful adult , but at least i wasn't afflicted by that man's violence .
then you accidentally see your body , or your face , or whatever , and you don't know who the hell it belongs to . strange . it's the business with the old man , i know , and how incredibly pissed i was at him , and also chasing jack hewitt like that , and the goddamned truck going through the ice , not to mention margie's being so upset one thing on top of another .
wade , are you alright ?
i know what it means . i'm just running out of ways to use it .
for what ?
to help , jack , of course and to nail those sonsofbitches , the two gordons . that's what alma calls them . jesus , rolfe , whose side are you on ?
take care of the little things first , the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things . call chub merritt , get your car back , call a dentist , for god's sake , and get your tooth pulled , don't trust the locals , get your facts straight and go straight to the state police . let them work on this .
rolfe .
a lesson in work and its rewards . you'll thank me for this one day . sally , turn off that tv !
just do it .
what was that ? you got something to say , say it ! say it !
nothing .
you no good pup !
jesus , pop , how can you stand the cold , dressed like that ? where's ma ?
sleeping .
you remember margie fogg ?
from wickham's . been a while . like some coffee ?
how you and ma doing ? haven't seen you in town for a while .
we're alright . your ma's sleeping . you want me to get her ?
where's ma ?
she's coming .
yeah .
i checked on her . she had the electric heater . cold don't bother her as much as me . which is why i give her the heater .
is there something wrong with the phone ?
in the living room .
why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed ?
wade . i thought she was alright . till this morning she was .
listen , it's no big deal , pop .
come on , smart guy . tell how it's no big deal . tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head .
pop , for christ's sake !
you ! by christ , you i know you . yeah , you goddamn sonofabitch , i know you . you're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart !
you don't know me . you don't know me ! so fuck you . fuck you .
nah nah naw ! you done done finally done it ! like a man done it . done it right . i love you , you mean sonofabitch !
love ! what the fuck do you know about love ?
love ! i'm made of love !
call it what you want .
everything you know is from me .
yeah .
bang !
you and me .
where the christ you going ? you sonofabitch , you leave my fucking truck where it is ! i need . give me the goddamn keys ! i need to get me to town !
crawl !
nothing in the fucking house to drink . not a fucking thing . my house , my money , my truck stolen !
i don't know you . my goddamn father and i don't know you .
take care , wade .
it don't look right .
what ?
the sign . it looks like it's spelled wrong or something .
fuck . wade whitehouse . it's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering . whatever somebody does to improve things around here , you gotta find fault with it .
i'm not finding fault . it's a good idea , good for you , good for the town . real modern too .
this town sucks .
aw , c'mon , i was only saying there's something wrong with home made cooking , that's all . the sign's fine . what it says is wrong .
marg !
that goddamned woman . thinks she can cart jill off and leave me alone like this . i'm more than pissed , margie . i'm a whole lot more than pissed . i been that plenty and i know the difference . this is different .
you talked to jack ?
not since last night . he took a guy hunting .
the fucker shot himself . ker bang ! that's what it sounds like . not on purpose . i assume accidental .
jack ?
the other guy .
where . how'd you hear that ?
cb . little while ago . one of the boys on the way in picked up jack on the cb calling for state troopers . i figured you'd know what really happened . the fucking guy kill himself ? this twombley , who the fuck is he , anyhow ?
jillie , you want a cheese grilled sandwich ?
wade , i got a message for you . jack hewitt , he's looking for you . wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in town hall .
his office . you mean my old office .
well , i guess that's what he said .
he got his deer yet ?
no , he's out now . somewhere on the mountain . i'd stay away from him if i were you . he's real pissed .
who are you ?
i was . i'm wade whitehouse . i was wondering , is your husband here ?
he's asleep . we were up very late .
well , yes , i'm . i want to say that i'm real sorry about your father , mrs . twombley .
mrs . gordon . thank you .
well , yeah , i suppose . sure . i just had a little business to settle with mr . gordon . i'm the local police officer .
something about my father ?
oh , no . no , it's a . it's a traffic thing . no big deal .
can't it wait , then ?
whitehouse . next time , phone ahead .
how's that ?
i said , 'next time , phone ahead . '
jesus christ . mr . gordon , when i come all the way to serve somebody a summons , i don't call ahead for an appointment .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i'm issuing you a ticket . moving violation .
moving violation ! i just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket ? now ? are you nuts ? is that it , whitehouse ? you're nuts ?
yesterday morning , you passed a stopped school bus , which was flashing its lights , then you
hold on !
don't ever put your hands on me , mr . gordon .
you're talking about a goddamned ticket , from when i passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something ?
don't give me a hard time , mr . gordon . i'm just
doing your fucking job . i know . i watch television too .
yes . here's your ticket .
you get the hell out of my house now , asshole . and know this you are going to be a lucky asshole if i haven't got you fired before the day is out . i can do it with one phone call , and i'm pissed enough to do it now !
have you been heating the house ? not just with the stove .
there's a furnace .
you're not using it today ?
it's broke i guess . there's an electric in the bedroom .
maybe wade should take a look at it . your pipes'll freeze . wade , would you do that ?
coffee's perked .
when did she die ?
it makes me sad .
can ?
makes me sad it was her . instead of me . i shoulda froze .
new hat ? jill's up , i see .
for a while .
how's she doing ?
okay . she's fine .
don't worry . i can protect my virtue . i mean , c'mon , wade , give me a break .
see you tomorrow , maybe .
you okay ?
yeah .
you okay ?
yeah .
i'm sorry about what i said .
said what ?
about you and jill and needing a third person . she went back to lillian ?
forget it .
i'm sorry .
i'm going to start one of those custody suits . i don't give a fucking shit . you know ?
you don't mean that .
yeah . i mean that .
no you don't . you're pissed , that's all . you ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with lillian . you know ? work it out with her , tell her how you feel . lillian's not out to get you .
the hell she isn't . lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day i met her . i'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from concord and get this thing , this divorce thing , rearranged . i've been thinking about it a lot . it's like she owns jill or something . nobody owns nobody , especially not kids . and i pay her .
call me .
tonight . let's get together .
jack's sort of sensitive , i guess . more than most . but he'll be okay in a few weeks .
there's something funny about that shooting . there's lots funny about it , actually .
i heard he was drunk at toby's last night and got in a fight with hettie . he drove off without her .
i'm sure , i'm positive it didn't happen the way jack says it did .
. jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry . he used to be a sweet kid , but it's like , when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore , he changed . now he's like everyone else .
i've been wondering if maybe jack shot twombley , instead of twombley shooting himself . i've been wondering maybe jack shot him on purpose .
wade ! how can you even think such a thing ? why would jack hewitt do that , shoot twombley on purpose ?
money .
jack doesn't need money .
everybody needs money . except guys like twombley and that sonofabitch son in law of his . people like that .
jack wouldn't kill for it . besides , who would pay him ?
lots of people . guy like evan twombley , boston union official , probably got lots of people want to see him dead . the government's been investigating his links with the mafia .
the mafia hire jack hewitt ?
no , i just know jack's lying about what happened . he just seemed i know that kid , what he's like inside . he's a lot like i was at his age .
you wouldn't have done anything like that , shot someone for money .
no . not for money . but , if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse i was pretty fucked up , you know .
but not now .
i can see what you looked like as a kid .
you knew me as a kid .
yeah , but never what you looked like . not really . never really studied your face , like now . i was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now , this way .
what way ?
after making love . i like it . it's nice to see that in a grown up person .
don't you think , do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing just now ?
i'm her father supposed to be , but i'm not able to . yes . yes , i am . it may be the only thing in my life i've been so clear about wanting . even if it takes a big fight .
then . i guess you have to .
there's another thing i've been thinking about . i don't know how you feel about the idea , margie , because we've never talked about it . but i've been thinking lately , i've been thinking we should get married sometime . you and me .
oh , wade .
i've been thinking about it , that's all .
you've been married twice
it was to the same woman . i was just a kid . it's not like a marriage proposal or anything , just a thought . something for you and me to talk about and think about . you know ?
alright . i'll think about it .
good .
did you tell them ? that we were coming ?
don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents ?
i know your parents .
i just want to pick up my divorce papers . for the lawyer . it won't take long .
are you sure they're home ? did you call ?
strange .
think they're alright ?
of course ! i would've heard .
how ?
this is nuts .
what happened ?
jesus christ , pop , let's go home . i got waylaid . sorry .
what on earth is happening to you ? why are you acting this way ?
it's my tooth ! my fucking tooth ! i can't even think anymore because of it .
i heard you talking . you got fired this morning , didn't you ?
going somewhere , margie ?
i'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up . for the rummage sale . and some things for the cleaners . and the laundromat .
don't lie to me . you're leaving me , i can see that .
don't be silly . hi , jill .
are you okay , wade ? what was wrong ? why were you holding everyone up ?
did you see that sonofabitch in the bmw ? he could've killed somebody .
did you get his number ?
i know who it is .
good . who ?
mel gordon .
i still don't understand
lillian !
where's jill ?
me and jill , we just had a little spat . she felt kind of left out , i guess , from not knowing some of the new kids
while you went off for a few beers with your friends ? is that hettie rodgers there , with whatzizname ?
yeah .
she's grown up some , hasn't she ?
i don't want her to go , lillian .
don't cause a scene . no one's trying to win any 'rounds' . don't make it any worse .
you ever come to your father's grave anymore ?
no , not anymore . it's too . it's too far .
we should talk .
we've done all our talking , wade .
it's just .
wait there . she'll be right out . is there snow on the ground up in lawford ?
yeah , lots .
see . get your boots .
no problem . look , i .
you make me sick . i can't believe you've sunk so low .
low as what ? what have i done ? it's bad to want to see your own daughter ?
you know what i'm talking about . for what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much . love . you won't get away with it .
we're looking for the funniest costume ! and the scariest ! and the most imaginative ! and the best costume of all !
tomorrow , gordon .
told you the snow was coming down . take the grader .
where's the plow ?
jimmy took it . jack's out hunting with evan twombley .
his son in law damn near killed me .
huh ?
at the school crossing . in his bmw . coulda hurt some kids . i'm gonna bust his ass .
don't go playing policeman .
what am i a security guard ? you hired me , you and your selectman friends .
you don't want the extra police pay ?
i'm not saying that .
get the grader . go out past toby's . don't let lillian get to you . she didn't belong here . that's why she left .
fuck you .
what's the hurry ?
a hunting accident . jack and twombley .
huh ?
i figured you already heard .
fuck . turn it off . all you heard was there was some kinda accident ?
twombley's shot . i heard that . not jack . he's okay , i assume .
fuck . you don't know how bad or anything ?
you mean twombley ?
yes , wade , i mean twombley . put out that cigarette . fuck . fuck . fuck .
he more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something . that's what usually happens .
i shoulda sent you instead of jack .
i wish you had . i'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader .
you ain't the hunter jack is . and he can't drive the grader worth shit .
like hell .
that must've been twombley . jesus . i bet that was twombley .
you want me to follow them to littleton ?
what the fuck . my day's already ruined . give me the keys . you can go back with jack . you still got a shitload of plowing to do .
it ain't done , if that's what you mean .
something bugging you ?
yeah . a few things .
how you holding up , wade ?
i'm fine , fine .
you rolfe ? i remember you from high school . you're a teacher now ? harvard ?
sorry about the long lunch . my clutch is going out again .
you ever think of getting a new car , wade ?
on what you pay me ?
elaine ! call chub meritt and have him pick up wade's car , fix the clutch .
what do i have to do for it ?
nothing , wade , i've been thinking . you don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little .
i saw mel gordon in here this morning .
so ?
he say anything about the summons i tried to give him ? sonofabitch wouldn't accept it .
wade , that wasn't smart . going out right after the man's father in law shot himself . let it go . call it a favor to me .
you ? why ?
mel's doing some business with me . it's nice to do favors for people you do business with . he was in a hurry . no big deal .
that was before twombley was shot . before he knew .
what's the difference ? take my truck , take a rest stop worrying about mel gordon . have you decided what to do with your old man's place he going to stay there ?
want to buy ?
don't light that in here . i'm allergic .
i won't . you interested ?
maybe .
you and mel gordon ?
could be .
always count on old wade for a good screwing . why should i always pay more , sell cheap ? why should you guys make all the money . you and mel and jack . right's right .
wade , you're done . let me have the shop keys .
you two , don't you get it ? he's using you . you're his slaves . jesus christ , jack , don't you see that ?
the key , wade .
i'm sorry for the screw up . but i couldn't help it it's too late to go trick or treating now . i couldn't help it i had to stop at penny's for the costume . and you were hungry , remember .
who's fault is it then if it's not yours ? you're the one in charge , daddy .
yeah .
look . those kids are still trick or treating . they're still out .
those are the hoyts .
i don't care . they're out .
can't you see . look out there . nobody's got their porch lights on anymore . it's too late . those hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble . see , they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there . they chopped down herb crane's new bushes . little bastards . jesus h . christ .
why do they do that ?
do what ?
you know .
break stuff ?
yeah . it's stupid .
i guess they're stupid .
did you do that when you were a kid ?
well , yeah . sort of . nothing really mean . me and my pals , me and my brothers . it was kind of funny then . stealing pumpkins , soaping windows . stuff like that .
was it funny ?
to us it was .
but it's not funny now .
it's not funny now . i'm a cop and i gotta listen to all the complaints people make . i'm not a kid anymore . you change .
i bet you did lots of bad things .
what are you talking about ?
i just think you used to be bad .
no . i didn't used to be bad . no sir . where do you get this stuff ? from your mother ?
no . she doesn't talk about you anymore .
go on , jill . some of those kids you still know .
i don't want to .
why ? why not ? you know these kids from when you went to school here . it hasn't been that long .
it's not that .
what then ?
it's stupid .
it's fun .
i want to go home . i don't like it here .
some party , huh ? sorry i lost sight of you . i had to step outside for a smoke . you find anybody you know here ? there must be some kids you used to know from school . you want to go tomorrow ? see your old teachers ? be more fun than hanging out with me all day .
no .
no what ?
no i didn't see anybody i know . no i don't want to go to school here tomorrow . i want to go home .
you are home . there are lots of kids you still know here .
i don't want to be here . don't worry , i love you , daddy , i do . but i want to go home .
jesus . listen , jill , tell you what . tomorrow morning , you still want to go home , i'll drive you down . i'll get off work or something .
i called mommy .
what ? you called mommy ? just now ?
yes .
jesus , why ?
i . because i want to go home . she said she'd come and get me .
come and get you ! shit ! it's a damn half hour drive each way . why didn't you talk to me about it first ?
see , i knew you'd be mad .
yeah . yeah , right , i'm mad . what'd you tell her , for christ sake ?
i told her i wanted to come home . daddy , don't be mad at me .
she's gone already ! gone already ! couldn't wait .
yes .
that's all you got to say ? yes .
yes .
she won't be here for a half hour . think you can stand it that long ?
yes .
sit right there by yourself if you want . wait for her by yourself . that's fine with me . just dandy . i'm going downstairs .
dad .
i'm glad you're here . can you stay for a while ?
are we going in this ?
yeah . my car's in the shop . this'll be fine .
it's pretty old .
it belongs to pop .
pop ?
grandpa . my father . it's his .
oh .
how about a big mac ?
mommy won't let me eat fast food . you know that . it's bad for you .
c'mon , we can always sneak a big mac . and a cherry turnover . your favorite . what do you say ?
no .
what do you want , then ?
nothing .
you can't have nothing , jill . we need lunch . mr . pizza ?
same thing , daddy . mommy says
i know what mommy says . i'm in charge today , though .
okay . so we'll get what you want . what do you want ?
nothing , i guess . i guess i can wait till we get home . maybe we'll stop by wickham's for a hamburger when we get to lawford . that suit you ? you always like wickham's .
okay .
please don't cry . please , honey .
what are you sorry for ?
i don't know . for the food business . i guess . i just thought , you know , we'd sneak a big mac on mommy , like we used to .
i want to go home .
you can't .
that's illegal , you know .
i know .
you're a policeman .
nope . not anymore . i'm nothing anymore .
oh .
jill , please , it's alright . nothing happened .
i want to go home .
don't mind if i do .
lariviere's having a hell of a time in there . master of fucking ceremonies .
where's that gun you were bragging on today ?
no brag . just fact .
i thought i told you to move that truck !
relax , chief . we're leaving . you wanna toke ?
you gotta be more careful about that shit . gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you . and i'll be outta a job .
some job . here , have a hit . don't be such a hardass . i know you got problems , but everybody's got problems .
not here .
got a job first thing in the morning , first day of season . saturday i'll hunt for myself . twombley something . er
evan . he's a mucky muck union official from massachusetts . you're lucky .
don't know about lucky . the guy's a full blown asshole . pay's good , though . a day . i got to guarantee a kill , of course . which i can do . there's some monster bucks hiding out up there .
how'd you get the job ?
like you and gordon ?
right . the sonofabitch couldn't get along without me .
yeah , he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him .
right !
bastard's got his high beams on .
aw , shit , she's here to get jill . me and jill had a little argument . jack , i got to get back , get back to town . move this thing , will you ? see if you can get back to the town hall before they get there , okay ?
piece of fucking cake .
where'd twombley get shot ?
in the chest .
no , i mean whereabouts .
a half mile in , along the old lumber road .
you bring him up yourself ? that's a steep climb .
the ambulance guys lugged him up .
you stayed away ?
yeah .
where'd you get the blood ?
what blood ?
on your sleeve .
musta . how'd i know ? what're you doing , playing cop ?
i gotta make a report to fish and game . i was just wondering , that's all . what'd he do , to shoot himself , i mean ?
who the fuck knows ? musta slipped or something . i just heard the gun go off .
i never seen a man shot before . not even in the service . must be something .
well , i didn't actually see him do it . like i said .
sure you did .
what ?
saw him do it ?
what the fuck you telling me , wade ? i never seen the guy get shot , i told you that .
you musta seen him get shot . i know you did .
let's get the fuck outta here . you're not making any sense , man .
there's your old twenty gauge , and that there's the new browning you was showing me last night . this must be twombley's gun . brand new . very fancy tooling . probably fired one time . it's a beautiful piece of work . but what the hell , jack , i guess you deserve it . right's right .
yeah .
twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again .
i'm fucking out of here .
lawford ?
open the door , will ya ?
why don't you quit now , you want out so bad ?
open the door . we're late .
i mean it you got enough money now . head out for california . surf's up , jack , and you're digging wells in the snow .
what do you mean i got money ? i'm as broke as you .
it's not enough snow , not for tracking the bastards . no advantage there , kid .
don't worry , mr . twombley , i know where those suckers are . rain or shine , snow or no snow . i know deer . we'll kill us a buck today . guaranteed . before ten .
guaranteed , eh ?
yep . right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles . the bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks . this gun gets fired before ten o'clock . whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you . i'll put you inside , yards of a buck the first four hours of the season . that's what you're paying me for , ain't it ?
damn straight !
done much shooting with that rifle yet ?
tell you what . you get me close to a big buck by ten , kid , there's another hundred bucks in it .
if you get it ?
yeah .
you might not kill it .
you think so .
you might gut shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag . can't guarantee that won't happen , especially with a new gun . i may have to shoot it .
you take care of your end , kid , i'll take care of mine .
mmm .
you understand what i'm saying ? i want a deer , a dead one , not a cripple or whatthefuck .
i get it . no sweat . you'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead . and you'll have him by coffee time .
and you'll get your extra hundred bucks .
wonderful !
i'm okay .
i used to play ball .
yeah ?
drafted by the red sox .
you played for the sox ?
double a . new britain .
oh .
pitcher . best ballplayer to come out of new hampshire since carlton fisk .
really .
they said .
hmm .
the only difference between me and that clemens on tv is luck , shit luck .
what happened ?
safety on ?
yeah .
this way .
sun's gettin high .
fresh tracks . deer shit . big one . here's your buck , mr . twombley . i'll circle around .
you only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks .
you heard the news .
i hear twombley got shot .
yeah .
you see it ?
nope . heard it . we wasn't far apart . i spotted this buck , then i heard the gun go off and twombley was gone . i looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was , deader'n shit . called it right in .
might as well take the rest of the day off . you look sort of fucked up . you've been paid for the day , anyhow , right ?
not exactly . i mean , he never paid me .
you'll get your money . don't talk to any newspapers about this . twombley's a big deal down in massachusetts , you know . tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment .
lawyer ? i don't need no lawyer , do i ?
he's on to us !
shit ! what are we gonna do ?
maybe i can buy him off . i gotta talk to mel .
you can't buy wade off .
we bought you .
that was me .
i screwed up the divorce . i agreed with everything she said . i wanted her to like me . i just want to be a good father .
it would help if you were married , if there was someone at home while you work .
i plan to . soon .
how soon ?
this spring .
good . it would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex wife . sexual problems upsetting to the child .
it looks pretty hopeless , don't it ?
no , not exactly . i'll look at the divorce decree , see if we can get it redrawn . interview your daughter . jill , right ?
yes .
fine . i'll need a retainer . you can mail it .
jesus . how much . how much will the whole thing cost ?
hard to say . if we go for custody , depositions , psychiatric evaluations , it could drag on . ten or twelve thousand dollars . she could win on appeal . if we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn , assuming they're unduly restrictive , it wouldn't be more than twenty five hundred .
oh .
you might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the
what are you boys up to ?
the good news is we haven't got to your car yet . the bad news
just tell me when you'll have it fixed .
the bad news is there's a problem with gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night . figured you'd know something about that , wade .
yeah . i know about that .
lariviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car . a couple hundred for the clutch . i got some more bad news . wanna hear it ?
tell me .
chub says you're fired .
he can't fire me . lariviere already did that this morning .
he's a selectman . the town . he said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office . i'm supposed to pull the cb and police light out of your car . they're town property .
you got yourself a computer , alma .
been putting my files into it . you take sugar and milk ?
no . black .
are you alright , wade ?
yeah , sure . why ? i got this damned tooth , i got a few things bugging me , like everybody else . but i'm okay .
well , you look . sad . upset . i don't mean to pry . i'm sorry about your mother . it was a nice funeral .
alma , i think there's some dirty business going on in this town .
always has been .
this is maybe worse than you and i are used to . what i'm talking about , i'm talking about murder . among other things .
who ?
evan twombley , the union boss who got shot . somebody murdered him .
who ?
. if jack told the truth , he could be free by the time he's my age .
sometimes things are simpler than you think . let me ask you a question .
you don't believe me ?
about jack ? no . have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately ?
i know he's due for the last two years . i was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in .
has anybody offered to buy it ?
as a mater of fact , yes . lariviere .
this is from three years ago . some difference , huh ?
what is the northcountry development association ?
i went down to concord to check it out . the president is mel gordon . the vice president and treasurer is gordon lariviere . those boys are buying up the mountain , wade . , this year . i believe that's out of lariviere's league .
twombley involved ?
no .
he musta found out . they had to get rid of him . and jack'll get blamed .
my yeoman will show you to your quarters .
thank you .
see what ?
the pattern . each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the pole . a line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle .
well , i'll be !
just musing about our 'one eyed adversary' and the legend of homer . 'cyclopes' were the sons of heaven , who forged the thunder bolts thrown by zeus .
you plotted the course of cyclops ? then that's u our u course ! wherever u he u goes , u we u go . until we get him !
we've asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times .
due north . at five knots . no , six !
cyclops will have to linger at the pole to recharge his power banks .
all right go to it .
remove your weapons , commander . and come here alone !
that's a u face u ?
point of view is everything . to us , u your u form of life is ugly as we appear to you .
tell me something why can u i u hear you , when the others couldn't ?
my mission is to study various solar systems , and planets select the most suitable for colonization
swell !
your friend was to remain where he was !
he did !
i am afraid not . therefore
why not me ? what am i the closing act ?
on the contrary . i want you unharmed perfect .
why ?
it is a living thing . when damaged you would say 'wounded' it immediately 'heals' itself .
that's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you ?
of course . but it is time to be gin the return voyage
to navigate , won't you have to . see your way ?
obviously .
thought you were going to washington , skipper .
i did go . just back . reef , these are a couple of our passengers sir ian hunt , and dr . clifford kent . my exec , commander richard holloway .
i met dr . kent , once .
i'm afraid i have some bad news for you , reef you'll have to share quarters , this trip .
who with ?
dr . neilsen . he'll be
'doctor' neilsen ? when did u that u happen ?
huh ?
it'll be all right . we're old friends !
what do you think ?
i think i should have joined the air force !
determine extent of damage , immediately .
you're sure it's cyclops ?
what's the running time ?
right u at u him ?
that's what i said !
but what can we accomplish ?
a hundred and eighty fathoms ! we can't be sinking that fast .
it's the screws , skipper . at our declination angle , running in reverse , they're pulling the shark u and u cyclops right to the bottom .
and we're at safe maximum depth already . stop engines !
suppose there's an atmosphere , of some kind , inside cyclops ?
what ?
straight to the pole at almost fifty knots !
what's the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole ?
minus three .
it doesn't seem possible , but could it be an electrical storm center ?
under u water u ?
high intensity arcs will burn , submerged . and millions of volts . discharged in random directions .
. above murmansk , and finland .
suppose our theorizing is correct ? then this u could u be the next danger point !
what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit ? perhaps be lying there waiting ?
we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear . but suppose it isn't at all what if it's u magnetic u ?
u we u harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force . maybe cyclops does it on a u super u scale .
the north pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all the earth itself !
. in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and , as you put it . . 'recharging his batteries' ?
the radiation level from the saucer it's rising !
as we near the pole .
there's got to be an explanation !
all ready ?
as ready as we u can u be ! i'll report to the skipper .
we read you ! go ahead , doctor ! they're inside the saucer . it's filled with breathable air !
wonderful !
now they feel it . down below .
excuse me , captain there may be one last , desperate chance a one in a thousand shot .
anything
it's possible i could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the icbm so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the pole .
what about time . ?
excuse me , skipper
yes , griff ?
skipper could you take a look here . ?
something wrong ?
the inertial navigation system . must have been knocked out in the crash .
why do you say that ?
we're dead in the water . but it indicates we're moving !
get ready . we shove off as soon as griff reports all the crew aboard .
right , skipper .
is there any way out of it ?
seems to be all around .
what about down ?
i . don't know !
course and speed ?
a mass of jelly like stuff came out of the thing , and caught our torpedo !
what ?
what course , skipper ?
you better take powell and carney with you
the frogmen ?
with their underwater experience , they'll be invaluable . take sidearms , and flare pistols
sidearms ? but the saucer's dead .
we hope !
now , dave old buddy , you know you're exaggerating what do you think of this husband of yours ? on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the exec and his navigation and firing officer . but unfortunately , in the case of lieutenant dave milburn of the tiger shark and myself
but julie's a nice girl , and i've seen you work . she deserves a fighting chance !
helen . i appeal to you
reef !
so they caught up with you , too ?
at the worst possible moment . tomorrow is janie's birthday . poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home . now
u that's u the worst possible moment ?
what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl ?
you've asked why i stay a bachelor ? there goes the best reason i know !
huh ?
i guess skipper neilsen re tired before you enrolled at the academy , didn't he ?
i guess .
one of the finest men , and officers , alive . a real hero in the best sense of the word in world war two . he taught us engineering and design . fought like a demon to develop atom subs .
so ?
so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school , be gins making noises like a pacifist . a real egghead , do gooder , and crackpot ! 'ban the atom tests ! junk the nuclear subs ! spend the mili tary budgetfor peace ! '
a lot of people think like that .
but u they're u not skipper neilsen's son ! it broke his heart . then when some newspapers called carl 'the honest , sincere son of a war mongering father' captain neilsen resigned from the navy . oh , he still keeps his hand in playing around with projects like the 'lungfish' but it broke him , all the same .
have you ever talked to carl tried to see his side ?
cyclops ?
sounds like it ! distress call , from a small freighter , between ellesmere island and greenland . one mayday , then . nothing .
we're stuck tight !
you've got to let us try , skipper
'us ? '
reef and i can take the explorer down , clamp it around the eye , and
you all wait here . i'm going inside , take a look .
how about that ! the bow drove half through her , but she sealed herself right up .
what's more important there's our problem . the bow ram the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break . if we can cut the ram , the shark can pull herself loose !
i think you're right .
go back and tell dr . neilsen . have him report to the skipper .
yeah ?
listen ! hear that ?
i don't hear anything . maybe you've been down here too long . why don't you go back up and
strange you didn't hear it . omit f
hey you know somethin' ? it's getting lighter in here !
you know it u is u ?
and if i didn't u know u better i'd swear we were moving !
you hear that ?
where do you think the voice you heard was coming from ?
somewhere down there ?
wonder where powell and carney are ?
well ?
i'm with u you ! u
here keep these . it wants me to come alone .
oh it does ?
dave !
what's goin' on in here , lad ? what ?
i should have suspectcd , when i heard that 'doctor . ' i thought it was your father .
it was supposed to be . dad had a heart attack , two days ago .
how is he ?
it was moderate . he'll be all right . but it was out of the question , his coming along .
you could train someone else .
what is it ?
your 'out . ' this came for you .
my father ! he's not ?
dead ? matter of fact , he's much better . he's left the hospital .
what did you mean i'm 'out ? '
your father can be in nome , alaska , tomorrow . we have two choices ask them to send him out in a 'copter' , and take you off , or the shark can put back into nome .
you 'trade school boys' are all alike , aren't you ? anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold braided puppet is , ipso facto , a coward !
u you u said it . but i won't argue
wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage , u commander u ! it just so happens i'm u not u a coward physical or mental and before i'd risk my father's life .
we're u all u risking our lives !
that may be . but dad stays where u he u is , and i'm staying here !
you're really a mixed up oddball , aren't you ?
perhaps . but the idea of willingly going to u school u to spend my u life u at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder lizards i'm referring to war u that u strikes me as the u worst u cowardice of all being spiritually yellow !
you mean u nothing u is worth fighting for ?
peace the dignity of man the destiny of the human spirit ! show me a man who says you win u those u by fighting wars , and u i'll u show you an idiot !
you may not u win u them . but without men like your father , to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them or as much as we have of them they'd have disappeared , u long u ago !
unidentified flying objects .
then . this is a 'flying saucer ? '
that's enough , holloway . i've told you before , wearing boards on your shoulders , and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto matically endow you with back bone !
any more than being the son of captain neilsen does !
however our ideas disagree , as i've said before , i'm u not u a coward ! and it happens you've got no choice either u i u take you down there , in the lungfish , or you don't get there
i'd sooner swim !
they're so remote cold beautiful , the stars . but now i wonder
yes ?
which is the one we have to worry about ?
maybe just 'maybe' when their ship doesn't return they'll decide not to come here , after all .
but if they u do u ?
i don't know .
i wouldn't worry . so long as we have boats like the tiger shark and people like you , the skipper , dave , kent , sir ian and my father
dan . and he's taking alice with him pretty good dive yvonne . you've been practicing .
vomit ?
why don't you shut up and let her talk ! two of us died in the last two days , does that strike you as particularly normal ? !
mark .
i'm not finished i loved greta . a lot . and if maybe , just maybe , someone or some thing killed her , i'd like to hear about it !
it's okay .
stick around , please ?
you , too ?
he invited me to his house last night .
these things are wild . what do you think ?
all right kids , i tell you what we're gonna do . i've got swimming practice until six thirty today .
yeah .
that means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so i can lock up when i'm done .
have another one , sounds like you need it .
naah , i'm done . got to be on shift in a couple hours . aren't you going in ?
nah . it's getting too cold for me , and my wonderful mother will kill me if i screw up my hair . she's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night .
stop saying that , it's bullshit .
i want to talk about the baby .
look . dan's parents were pushing him . pushing him hard . he was bitching about it at the party last night . he was under pressure . we all are .
bottom line , alice . anybody , supernatural or not , that wants to hurt you he'll have to go through us first .
all of us . right ?
yeah , when are you gonna come to your senses ?
next life . oh , what's that ?
meet me later . milkshakes . cherry pie . banana splits . and no mom !
pimples , heartburn , cellulite . and no modeling career .
that club sucks , they card everybody . let's just party at your place .
you know my mother get real . what about alice's ?
he's right . sometimes i feel like i'm living with melicertes .
who ?
oh man ! i could've gone all night without looking at that .
i don't believe this . all that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish ?
give up , mark , it's hopeless .
i think i'm starting to wear her down . have some anyway .
not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis .
greta , come on . one burger with me ?
my dad's got this thing about drinking in the house .
i've got to write some of this down .
mark , are you okay ?
yeah . i'm just aces .
i want to talk to both you guys about greta . and .
i thought about that .
she must've fallen asleep at the table .
then get out !
mark !
do you think i'm an idiot . for being in love with her ?
nobody thinks that .
maybe it was her mother who killed her , with all that polly perfect shit .
it wasn't her mother . the only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party .
tell me some more about this krueger guy .
why don't i go make some coffee . there's a lot to tell .
who's jacob ?
my baby !
whoa , slow down . how're you gonna hide from a guy like that , leave the planet ?
where are you going ?
i'm going to see what else i can find out about mr . fred krueger
i couldn't do that , mark . he's my last link with dan . no , i want him .
then we'll find another way .
they think i'm nuts .
that's their problem .
no , it's our problem , mark . if i don't deal with this , they really might try to take jacob . you said she committed suicide ?
that's what the newspapers thought . she spent the rest of her life in the asylum . after krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself , so they thought .
meaning ?
they couldn't prove it . no body ! nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business .
but i've seen her grave .
empty plot . memorial stone . vacant . they never did put her under . cool , huh ?
poor woman .
no shit .
i don't understand .
she killed herself . her soul's gonna be in torment .
hey , what's wrong with you let's see a smile .
had kind of a long night .
dan keeping you up again ? put a lock on that window , girl .
good to see you again , mr . grey . i've got to go find dan .
yeah , before they revoke his diploma .
it was no accident . it was krueger . he used to get in through my dreams , but not anymore . he's found some other way .
alice , it's no dream . i'm sorry . dan's dead .
have you visited the little boy on my floor ? jacob , the one who looks kind of sad ?
there aren't any little boys on your floor .
did everyone call everyone ?
they're waiting for us . but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me .
what's that got to do with it ?
it was just an accident . like with dan .
i don't understand what's happening . krueger has to use my dreams , but he got to dan and greta while i was awake . how's he doing it ?
you had me scared on the phone . what's wrong with the baby ?
i think krueger's trying to do something to it .
oh , alice . no . honey , i love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself .
mark knows i'm not crazy . ask him to show you his hands .
i really think you need to calm down now , okay ?
i just can't figure out how he's getting in when i'm awake .
i am your friend , and i'm worried sick about you . but , you're like a locked safe . you've gotta start dealing with reality .
krueger is reality .
and so is your baby . you've got more than just yourself to think of now !
what do you think i'm doing ? look . whether you believe it or not , krueger is back . he's after the baby and if i don't try to do something about it , who will ?
all i know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman . why don't you take off leave springwood and cool out somewhere for a while ?
goddamn it , yvonne ! you don't just run away from this guy ! he finds you in your dreams .
look . we're all tired . none of us had any sleep since friday night .
are you alright ?
you think that's the place she's buried ?
if they actually bothered to bury her .
what ?
jacob . we've got to get to amanda before it's too late .
but how are we gonna
we've got to go to the asylum and find her body . mark said her soul's trapped with it that's why she can't come to me . it must be !
you do good work , alice .
so did dan .
he sure loves to stay awake .
i was afraid you weren't coming .
i watched from behind the stands . didn't want to embarrass you , ya know . the drunk showed up , that kind of thing .
that's in the past . unless you've stopped going to the meetings .
no . a deal's a deal .
dad !
where are we going ?
thanks for everything , dad .
you sure you don't want a ride to work ?
it's just across the park .
i'm so sorry , honey .
how was the meeting ?
sobering .
very funny .
alice .
since when are you such a smart shopper ?
since my little girl became a mom .
you disappointed in me ?
alice !
i've got to go .
no ! i won't have you running around in the middle of the night . you're coming home .
but dad
now .
hi , beautiful .
jesus ! don't do that !
sorry , babe .
the tickets .
they're coach seats , but the plane lands in paris . it's gonna be a helluva summer , hon !
i know .
okay , babe . what's the matter ?
nothing . it's just . i didn't see my father at the ceremony .
about him ?
no . well , not exactly . it's that . i felt like i wasn't in control . for the first time since . all that . i'm scared .
you stopped it didn't you ? it was probably just a regular bad dream .
yeah . i guess .
you don't dream him up , he can't hurt you . or me . or us . remember .
you're right .
there you go . love you .
me too .
hey . wake up .
shouldn't you be in your room , jacob ?
it's lonely in there , in my room .
my name is .
i'm sorry your boyfriend got killed .
how did you know that ?
i could tell you were sad . i just wanted to see if you were all right .
hi , you don't look very well . are you feeling all right ?
been having bad dreams .
is that who you're waiting for ?
no .
i don't think this is a nice place for you to be . maybe we should go find your mom .
she doesn't want me around
oh . i'm sure that's not true . i'll bet she's very worried about you . i would be .
no you're not . you don't even care about being a mom . how come you don't think about me ?
who says i don't like you ?
mommy . ?
where is he ?
he's inside you , where he hides .
what do you mean ?
it's where he hides out . inside . that's how he found me .
but how . ?
he says it's easy . especially with sad people . with closed off people .
excuse us , dear .
it's okay , dan
frankly , dear , we wondered what you intend to do with our baby ?
look , i appreciate what you're offering , but no . he is my responsibility .
in your present condition , alice , we're worried about your ability
what are you talking about ? my condition ? .
we know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here .
feeling better now ?
yeah . i guess so . what happened ?
you had a nasty bump .
i gotta get out of here .
you just stay put . you need rest .
you don't get it , he's after me .
don't worry , honey
something wrong with the stairs ?
avoid all contact day .
what ?
what is it ?
now you know who and what freddy really is .
i though freddy was just an old town story .
it's no story . it happened . freddy's real and he's back .
i'll tell you later .
it's no just a house . it's his home . he's waiting there for me . to dream .
it's okay , babe . we're with you .
i told you you can't help . this isn't a normal nightmare . i'm doomed .
something the matter with the cuisine ?
well mom , i'll tell ya , when two of your friends die the same day , you let me know what it does to your appetite .
you're just tired . don't think i haven't noticed your not sleeping . that has to stop , honey .
what's wrong with me ?
i'm sorry honey , but .
sorry ! sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me . in case you haven't been keeping score , it's his fucking banquet , and i'm the last course !
honey , we went over this in therapy .
mother , you've just murdered me . take that to your goddamn therapy .
t t thanks alice .
earth to alice .
hey , rick !
excuse me , ladies . i'll just be a moment .
i don't get it .
let me talk to you .
so what's up ? what'd i miss ?
she told us the story of freddy . it's a town legend . he was a child killer who was freed on a technicality .
so ?
it pissed off a lot of parents . according to kristen , they hunted him down roasted him alive .
nice neighborhood .
now it gets weird . she says he comes back in dreams . if he kills you there , you're dead for real .
hey man , we're all sorry .
been up with alice .
how she doing ? i ran into her last night .
she's blaming herself for sheila . i know how it feels . i've been thinking about kristen . maybe i could've stopped it , if i'd listened .
about freddy ?
what else ? you ever look over this town's history ? not a safe place to be a teenager . anyway , if i'm next , watch your back .
rick , please .
alright , i think i see salvation .
i think sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them .
asthma attack . what year old has a fatal asthma attack ? she was gonna be a doctor .
it was freddy .
enough of that crap .
no .
you're his sister , right ?
rick stayed later after school with kristen . she wasn't feeling very well .
tell him i was looking for him , okay ? i'm dan .
i know . uh . alice .
i thought it was an accident . smoking in bed .
i was there in the dream . he took her . it was awful . it was awful .
in her dream ?
no , don't ! i gave sheila to him and now she's dead !
kristen's story really got to her .
i've been working double shifts .
extra money , huh ?
look , you know why , you just don't believe me .
no offense , or anything , but it's kind of hard to swallow .
the story is , the deaths you can't argue with .
how long have you been awake ?
three days .
alright , let's assume this whole thing is true . why does freddy all of a sudden need you ?
not really .
is there something we can do ?
you don't really get it . he's not a nightstalker . it'll take more than bench presses to beat him .
why can't we just talk to the authorities ?
yeah , right . let's trade death by freddy for life in a rubber room . adults won't see it . they can't .
then what else can we do ?
try what other kids did . keep each other awake . we'll meet at debbie's tonight . at least if we don't sleep he can't get us .
who ?
he's going after debbie , i gotta stop him .
hey , you're not alone . we have to stop him , i'm with you .
you just feel sorry for me .
as long as your driving doesn't kill us .
he's going after debbie . i gotta stop him .
you know , i get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before .
here we are .
what the hell was that ?
debbie . she's gone . i've . collected her , like the others .
you look great !
you in a hurry ?
i gotta get to the library before it closes . killer physics test .
i know . i hardly have any time to study .
maybe you shouldn't be working here so much . you don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life .
i know .
ohhhhbaby , i am dead on my feet .
we have matching luggage .
what ?
you've been up all night ?
that obvious , huh ?
then you saw him , too ?
saw who ? i was up all night cramming for this physics test , and i was putting this little baby together . look .
here you are . where were you this morning ? rick's looking all over for you .
have you seen joey and kincaid ! god , i can't find them . i can't find them anywhere .
i'm sure they're around .
yeah , i'm not so sure .
i love to dream , i just hate ones about my dad .
you could do worse .
my mom taught me when i was little . did you ever hear of the dream master ?
sounds like a game show host to me .
no really , it's a fable . the 'guardian of good' dreams . it was like my teddy bear when i was growing up .
great , you wouldn't happen to know his phone number ?
i daydream . you have to dream about some place fun . remember you're in control .
how'd you learn so much about dreams ?
you what ?
when i used to have nightmares . i brought my friends in to help me . until they all started dying .
kristen , what happened ?
you'll hear all kinds of stories . they'll tell you it was murder , but it wasn't .
don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose ?
what ?
the mirror . you can't see yourself in it .
i don't want to .
yeah . she'd be half as strict as you .
but she wouldn't let dad treat me like that .
look , you gotta stand up for yourself . learn to fight back .
rick . i can't .
alice , you think you can leave ?
what's wrong ?
kincaid and joey died last night .
what ?
you alright ?
kristen .
i heard you screaming . was it a bad one ?
it was bad .
doesn't the dream master work for you anymore ?
i can't find him .
hey , since when do you play thomas edison ? this looks like sheila's .
it is . was . it's a zapper , it might help me stay awake .
yeah , or turn you into toast .
i can't go back to sleep again .
we'll figure it out .
figure it out ? ! ? ! i'll be insane before i figure it out . the only thing i'm sure of is that i can't go to sleep . not while he's using me .
okay , i'll take it all .
excellent . we accept mastercard and american express .
cash .
alright . may i have your phone number , area code first ?
no , you may not .
i'm required by state law to inform you that , while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items , it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of .
yeah , i know the spiel . if you could bag it , i'll be on my way , thank you .
certainly , sir .
your son in law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day , saw that woman every night . the specifics are in the report , and information about the woman . it's unpleasant , i know . i apologize .
none too discreet , is he ?
no , sir , he is not .
he's an imbecile . i tried to warn my daughter , but what can you do ?
the um . you'll find my invoice in the envelope . if that's all .
yes , mister welles , thank you .
certainly , senator . if i can ever be of further assistance .
yes . i remember mary
you . you do ? you're sure ? please , sister , will you take another look , make sure .
do you know what happened to her ?
what is this ?
those are her belongings .
her belongings ?
that's her suitcase . i had forgotten it , till you showed me her picture .
whatever possessed you to keep this all this time ?
she was the kindest , sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet . oh , i adored her . i supposed i always hoped she'd be back . after a time , all i could do was pray she had moved on to better things . can you get this suitcase to her parents , if you think it's appropriate ?
i'll do what i can .
yes . ?
i've been hired as an independent contractor by the u . s . resource center for missing persons as part of an internal audit . if you have any time over the next few days , i'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter .
i don't understand , who are . ?
i'm sorry , let me explain , the r . c . m . p . is a support organization and archive , not unlike the center for missing and exploited children in washington . i'm sure you've dealt with them before ?
yes , but .
what was the name . ? i've got it here somewhere .
neil . neil cole .
right , agent cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me . he didn't call ?
no .
it's very important you don't let this raise your expectations . it's not going to effect any ongoing efforts . all i'm saying is , please know , i'm not here to create any false hope .
they hired you . you're like , a private detective ?
that's exactly what i am .
i didn't think there were private detectives anymore , except on tv .
so , she didn't leave a note ? she never gave any indication where she might go , before she left ?
no .
she just seemed . depressed . ?
she didn't seem herself . for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it . one night we went to bed . the next morning she was gone . she took some clothes .
what was she running from ?
i don't know .
if there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about , tell me , but i have to ask . your husband . he committed suicide ?
yes .
september th , . about a year after mary disappeared .
we were divorced by then . things fell apart . he was living with a friend .
why do you think he did it ?
it got to be too much for him .
you have to forgive me , but in these circumstances . with your daughter . were there any indications of . any sort of abuse ?
there wasn't anything like that . the police and the fbi people asked , but there wasn't anything happened like that , never . my husband . his heart broke when mary left .
i didn't mean to .
you try going through what we did . bob couldn't take it , that's all . christ , there's times when it still seems like i can't either .
i had to ask . i apologize .
people remember me from the news . can you drive me back now ?
i . i shouldn't take anymore of your time . maybe we can finish tomorrow . i'll call tomorrow .
doesn't make much sense , does it ? when everything's happy , when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a god , you don't bother . then , something horrible happens . that's when you start praying all the time . that's when you start going to church .
we're all like that .
are you religious ?
no .
you should be .
i've got what i need for my report . there is . there is one thing that bothers me though .
what ?
it's not really my place , but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either . see , i know a little about missing persons . when kids run , they almost always leave a note . it's guilt . they want to say goodbye .
there wasn't one . the police looked .
do you think the police did a good job ?
i don't know . i think so .
it is possible . and i know this isn't something you want to hear . your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it , but where she knew your husband would never find it . she might have wanted to tell you something .
no . you don't have any reason to think that .
if the police focused their search in her room , her belongings , well that'd be only natural , but they may have been looking in the wrong place .
how . how can you say that to me . ?
will you let me look ?
my husband never laid a hand on her . she would have told me . she would have told me .
you were right . i didn't find anything . i'm going to run and get something to eat . are you hungry ?
i think about it everyday . but , every time the phone rings . every single time , i still think it's her .
it's been six years .
hello . ?
mrs . mathews ? it's thomas . do you remember , i was there a few weeks ago . asking about your daughter .
i remember . you just left .
i have to tell you something . it won't be easy for you to hear . it's about your daughter . mary anne . when i . when i was there with you , her diary , in your attic , in silverware . if you read it , you'll know what i'm telling you is true .
what are you talking about . ?
she went to california , to los angeles . she wanted to start over . she wanted to be an actress .
what . ?
mrs . mathews , your daughter is dead . she's dead .
who is this . ?
someone . some men , they took your daughter and they drugged her , and they took her to a motel room . they did terrible things to her .
who are you ?
they brought her into the room . one man , he put a knife to her throat and he raped her .
no .
he raped her and . and . and he murdered her . he cut her up with knifes .
no . no . no .
they killed her , and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her .
why . why are you doing this to me . ?
they murdered her , mrs . mathews , i'm sorry . it happened a month after she ran away . she's been dead all this time .
mister welles . you're very prompt .
uh huh , pleasure .
have a pleasant evening . will you have tea , mister welles ?
he's odd .
i've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's , in harrisburg , in lancaster and hershey . asking about you . i must say you have friends in influential places .
i've been privileged to provide services for people i admire .
as you know , my husband passed away recently . two weeks ago now .
my condolences .
his passing has left me with . something of a dilemma . a terrible , terrible dilemma .
pittsburgh ?
mostly . that's where he started his empire building . he was a good man . notorious as an eccentric , but that was something he cultivated . he wanted to be legendary .
he succeeded .
do you carry a gun , mr . welles ?
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to . other than that , there's never any reason .
my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe . i knew about it , but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business . not till now , that is .
you hired someone to open it . i'll bet the lawyer loved that .
there was nothing he could do . my husband left everything to me . i prevented anyone from seeing the contents . i felt these were my husband's private things . i didn't . i didn't realize .
do you want to tell me what you found ?
it's a film . of a girl being murdered .
i'm afraid i don't .
i didn't know what to think . i can't tell you how horrible it's been , to know this belonged to my husband . to know that he watched this . this atrocity . but , i can't go to the police .
please , believe me . this is probably a stag film . simulated rape . hard to stomach , and it might seem real , but there are ways of making it look realistic . fake blood and special effects .
no .
if you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away . you'd see the tricks they can play .
i'm telling you it's not that .
i'm sure it is . it's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke . more than likely he never even watched it .
will you watch it and see for yourself ?
you . you need to go to the police .
i told you i can't , not yet .
you don't have any other choice .
no . for me to live with the ruin of my husband's name , i need know that whoever did this will be punished . if you can find them , i will take their names to the police . i'll say my husband confessed on his death bed . i'll say i didn't have courage to come forward at first .
it won't work like that .
any evidence you collect can be given to the police later , anonymously . i've thought about it and there's no other way . if you can't find them . if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for , well i can't let that happen . i'm telling you i won't . if there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served , then i'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her .
i deal in divorce cases . corporate investigations .
you've found missing persons before .
nothing remotely like this .
i know what i'm asking . your compensation will be appropriate to the risk . you'll need cash to buy information , and i'll provide it . i feel responsible , mr . welles . you saw what he did to her .
okay .
my husband never dealt with money personally , certainly not cash .
i'm not positive this means anything .
one was for two hundred thousand , one dollar and thirteen cents . another was for three hundred thousand , six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents .
okay , i follow you so far .
totalled together , these five checks from five different accounts , they equal one million dollars .
you're joking .
hello . ?
i'm here .
do you think the film could have cost that much ?
for a human life . murder on film , no statute of limitations . who knows ? it sure could have . i'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks , then put them in a safe deposit box .
okay .
send it to me through the post office like we arranged . no return address . you dug this up all by yourself ?
you told me to look , so i looked .
you're one hell of a detective , mrs . christian .
hello ?
mrs . christian , tom welles here .
how are you ? having any luck ?
i don't know if luck's the word . are you feeling alright ?
i've been ordered into bed . the doctor says i've gotten the flu , or some other wretched ailment .
i hope it's nothing serious .
nothing more than a bother . have you any news for me ?
i've made progress . i'm in manhattan . once a few more pieces fall into place , i'll drive to you and give you an update .
fine .
i've got about five thousand left in cash , but i'll need another thirty , if you approve .
how will i get it to you ?
if you have a pencil and paper , i'll tell you how to send it .
big date tonight ?
yeah . guess so .
can i interest you in a battery operated vagina ?
pardon me ?
my boss tells me i have to do more suggestive selling .
well , it's tempting , but no thanks .
it's your call , but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery operated vagina and you don't have one .
i'll risk it .
once you pick it up you can't put it down .
truman capote .
i tear off the cover and paste this one on . you know how it is .
wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts .
might get drummed out of the pornographer's union , and then where would i be ?
remember me ?
came back for that battery operated vagina , right ? told you you would .
i need some information . thought you might be able to help .
i don't know what you're looking for , mister , but so we're clear from the start , i'm straight .
how long you been working there ?
three , four years .
what's your name , if you don't mind me asking ?
max .
well , here's the deal , max . this thing i'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography . stuff that's sold under the counter , illegally .
there's not much illegal .
well , whatever there is , whoever's dealing , however it's done , i want to know . i want a good look , so if you've got that kind of connection , great . if not , speak now .
you're not a cop , are you ? if i ask and you are , you have to tell me .
i'm not a cop .
you're a private eye . like shaft .
not quite .
from pennsylvania . p . i . from pa . what are you doing out here ?
well , there's the thing you're not gonna know anything about what i'm doing , but you can make some money .
how much ?
how much do you make now ?
four hundred a week , off the books .
okay , let's pretend i live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump . i'll give you six hundred for a few days .
sounds good , pops .
here's my number if you need it . when can you start ?
tomorrow night , i get off at eight .
. hello . ?
you've got penthouse , playboy , hustler , etc . nobody even considers them pornography anymore . then , there's mainstream hardcore . triple x . the difference is penetration . that's hardcore . that whole industry's up in the valley . writers , directors , porn stars . they're celebrities , or they think they are . they pump out videos a week . a week . they've even got a porno academy awards . america loves pornography . anybody tells you they never use pornography , they're lying . somebody's buying those videos . somebody's out there spending million dollars a year on phone sex . know what else ? it's only gonna get worse . more and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream , because that's evolution . desensitization . oh my god , elvis presley's wiggling his hips , how offensive ! nowadays , mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out . know what i mean ? for the porn addict , big tits aren't big enough after a while . they have to be the biggest tits ever . some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head , literally . soon , playboy is gonna be penthouse , penthouse'll be hustler , hustler'll be hardcore , and hardcore films'll be medical films . people'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds . there's nowhere else for it to go .
interesting theory .
what you saw tonight , we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend . we're talking about stuff where people get hurt . specialty product .
child pornography .
there's two kinds of specialty product legal and illegal . foot fetish , shit films , watersports , bondage , spanking , fisting , she males , hemaphrodites . it's beyond hardcore , but legal . this is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up , another guy looks at it and falls in love . now , with some of the s m and bondage films , they straddle the line . how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not ? step over that line , you're into kiddie porn . rape films , but there aren't many . i've never seen one .
snuff films .
i heard you asking . that guy wasn't yanking you around . there's no such thing .
what other ways are there to get illegal films ? who do you see ?
first of all , basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer . it's too risky , one , and two , everything's going on the internet . anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants . it's heaven for those degenerate chicken hawks . they're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em . but , there's still some weird shit under the counter where i work sometimes . no one knows where it comes from . that's local underground , where information spreads by word of mouth . those are zombies , hardcore junkies . their hands are permanently pruned . they go out in the sun they don't burn , they blister . other than that , all i know about is the mail . classified ads in the paper with hidden codes . secret couriers . credit card orders to dummy corporations . interstate wire transfers . revolving p . o . boxes . but , if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit . who knows ? that's the whole point the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible , and vice versa , and cops can't trace the deal . there's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is .
how old are you ?
twenty five .
where are your parents ?
i don't know , where are yours ?
i don't mean any offense . but what are you doing mixed up in all this ?
i'm not mixed up in anything , hayseed . what are you talking about ?
you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else .
yeah , i'm a real genius . what choices have i got ? fuck , just because i know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean i deal it . i work a job . it beats pumping gas , beats making hamburgers .
you're telling me it doesn't get to you ?
you can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb . so what ? am i gonna go off and be a race car driver ? go to harvard ? run for president ? what about you , pops ?
what about me ?
i see a ring on your finger . you have any kids ?
a daughter .
so , you have a wife and kid waiting for you in pennsylvania . what are you doing mixed up in all this ?
good question .
dino velvet . yeah , he's like the john luc godard of s m flicks , supposed to be a real weirdo .
a weirdo making s m films ? who'd have thought it ?
his stuff comes out of new york . bondage and fetish videos , gothic hardcore . definitely not for the squeamish .
specialty product .
you're learning .
where does he sell it ?
nothing illegal , it's always borderline . like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a .
alright , i get the picture .
he cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs , newsreel footage , subliminal images . thinks he's making art .
well , i'm in new york now . what do you say to flying out and giving me a hand ?
i'm a working stiff , pops .
take a vacation . i'll pay you four hundred a day , plus expenses .
you want me to come out there and play private eye ?
consider it . meanwhile , dig up whatever dino velvet films you can . get receipts . i'll call back .
you didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious .
it's their presidential suite .
oh , come on , man , what are we doing in this flea bag ?
it's cheap , and people know to mind their own business . what have you got for me ?
wha . ?
who is he ?
i told you , he's one of dino velvet's stock players .
who is he , his name ?
nobody knows his name . that's his thing . he always wears a mask . you never see his face . he calls himself machine , that's what they call him . machine .
you don't need to be here .
i know if i had to pick , it'd be choke , or devil .
devil frightened me as much as it excited me , but i'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite .
what's next ?
i'm trying to figure that out myself . i have to see machine without his mask .
still don't want to tell me what you're doing ?
nope .
what's this ?
it's money . people use it to purchase goods and services .
look . that's awful generous and everything .
it's not my money . the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought . let's not make a big deal out of this , okay ? go be a race car driver . go run for president . whatever .
yes , i do have something to say . i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs . christian contacted you .
i'm listening .
as mr . christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate , it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend .
of what sort ?
you are a private investigator ?
that's right .
well , whatever reasons mrs . christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator , i should certainly be a party to . but , since she feels differently , i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval .
you were the middleman , am i right ? old man christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself .
wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature .
so , he sent you , gave you the money , his errand boy . and if you refused , it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film . that's the beauty of lawyer client privilege .
that's trust . mr . christian trusted me implicitly .
must have paid you a lot , for you to risk everything . would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money .
i was well compensated .
that's why you got scared when mrs . christian hired me . you knew about the film , figured it had to be in that safe . how'd you find me ?
never mind how i found you .
followed me . must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies .
they're no friends of mine .
except , you're willing commit murder with them .
none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone . if you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago . a girl no one even remembers .
you found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film , right ? wanted them to find you one . well , they didn't find you one , longdale , they went out and made you one .
shut up .
mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered .
shut your mouth and drive !
did it get him off , huh , watching them cut her up ? tell me , because i really want to understand . did he jerk off to it ? you watch it with him , sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched . ?
you're making me very angry .
just tell me . tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared . what kind of degenerate pervert was he really ? what the fuck did he want with a snuff film ?
you're asking me why ?
i'm asking .
a man like mr . christian , a great man . all his money , all his power . a man who attained everything there was to attain .
why did he buy a film of some poor , lost girl getting butchered ?
isn't it incredibly obvious ?
enlighten me .
you almost went over your limit .
fuck you .
give me the film .
you'll get it when we get there .
give me the film .
go ahead , shoot me . then try driving to brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield .
he's lying .
look at him . you think he played it square ? how much did he give you , how much did he keep for himself ?
you know how my tapes sell . people eat this stuff up .
i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month . do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt , and try to fucking return it ?
maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place , ever think of that ?
the only thing wrong is the cheap , softcore crap you're peddling , eddie . where do you get this stuff ?
look , you cocksucker .
get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head . till then , fuck you .
celebrity films .
eddie .
yeah , who's this ?
i know what you did .
what ?
i know what you did .
who is this .
you murdered that girl , eddie . six years ago .
what the fuck are you . ?
you killed that girl and you put it on film . you and your pals , you're fucked . you fucked up real good .
what's he talking about ?
one million dollars , dino . how much did he tell you he had .
i'm gonna kill you .
don't bore me with that bullshit .
how'd you find me here ?
don't ask questions .
fuck you !
starting to recognize a pattern ?
what do you want ?
who is machine ?
i don't know .
i want his name .
i told you , i don't know .
i will never get tired of hurting you , eddie , so you might want to change your attitude .
what the fuck am i gonna protect that freak for ? he was dino's boy , not mine . he shows up with his mask on , leaves with his mask on . nobody knows .
okay , we'll come back to that . so , six years ago a guy contacts you , through the classifieds , over the phone , however he does it . it's longdale , looking for a snuff film . and you , entrepreneur that you are , tell him you can hook him up .
yeah , the fucking lawyer .
told him you could get him a snuff film .
yeah .
how much did he pay you ?
thirty thousand each , that fucking cocksucker .
that's all ? thirty each . that's all it took for you to murder her ?
it was a lot of fucking money .
so . you brought dino in , and he brought machine . and , one day , a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models . and she never walked out .
something like that .
what did you do , knock her out , shoot her up . ?
what the fuck do you want from me ?
i want to know . i want to know exactly what you did to her !
fuck you then , you want to know ? i talked her up , told her how beautiful she was , told her she was gonna be a star . i told her i was gonna get her a screen test , and while i'm doing that , i got her a soda and dropped a mickey . when it was dark enough , i rang dino and told him it was go time , i put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it . that's what happened . she's dead . she's been dead a long fucking time . nobody fucking cares !
show me where you did it , on the map , exactly where you did it .
why ?
because we're going there .
i don't know . i felt like it . i never saw anyone get done before .
you enjoy it ?
made me sick , but what did i care ? what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that . it was just something i was doing for money .
tell me what happened .
what do you want to know ? you saw it , you saw the loop .
nobody saw you bring her in ?
there wasn't nobody around . this place was a shit hole . i backed up the car to the door and we carried her in , like groceries . dino made her eat a bunch of pills , we laid out the plastic , put film in the camera and machine went to work .
what did you do with her body ?
took it out the bathroom window . buried it in the woods .
keep moving .
you can't go to the cops . all you can do is cut me loose and walk away , because you got nothing .
stop talking .
you got absolute zero .
show me where you buried her .
i don't know . . out there somewhere .
where ? show me where .
do it .
don't think i won't .
do it ! put me out of my misery so i don't have to listen to you whining anymore . you think it's so easy ?
easy enough for you .
i never killed anyone .
that's right , you just stood there and watched , because you felt like it . almost makes you worse .
what do you want ? you want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby . ?
what can i do for you , mr . welles ?
call me tom .
alright , tom .
what i'd like , very simply , is access to your archive . and , now i understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens .
there are reasons for the way we do things here .
few days ago , i was contacted by a couple living in philadelphia , a doctor and his wife . what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off , which heads into philadelphia , started up a conversation with this girl , she looked homeless , seemed about eighteen maybe . they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city . nice kid , mature , didn't have much to say , but they got a sense she's a runaway , so all through dinner the doctor's working on her , trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone . not surprisingly , she ate her food , excused herself . that's the last they saw her . the reason they came to me for help , the reason i'm coming to you , is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch . they want to see if i can i . d . this girl , somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive , doing alright .
why not go to the n . c . i . c . or n . c . m . e . c . ?
i figured you share information .
we do .
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive .
why don't they come to me ?
this doctor and wife , they're nice people , but they don't want to get too involved . they're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either . you and i both know sometimes , not often , but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run . molestation , whatever . besides that , the girl's probably eighteen , so she's legal .
i'm not so sure about this .
they're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay , even if that's all they hear .
i can give you my card , if your clients want to call me .
they were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them .
files are mostly by state and year of disappearance . we try to keep the children and adults separate . no eating or smoking in here , but there's a coffee machine in the hall .
any good ?
it's horrible , but it'll be your best friend after a few days . i hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after .
you're gonna be seeing a lot of me . you're sure you don't mind ?
it's good what you're doing .
is that him ?
don't let longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas . if his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you , you'll be just as dead . and so will max .
you're a dead man .
leave him alone .
. sorry .
first things first . you might want to watch this , mr . welles .
you got the guts , tough guy ? gonna kill us all , is that it ?
you betrayed us .
it's an honor to meet you . thank you for seeing us .
what can i do for you today ?
i'd like to commission a work . i'm a great admirer of yours .
flattering . and , who's your colorful little chum ?
a fellow investor .
you said something about money .
that's five thousand dollars .
is it ?
five thousand now , five thousand on delivery . two women , one white and one black , as long as they have large breasts . hard bondage , or course . other than that , trusting your artistic interpretation , i have only two stipulations .
and they are ?
i want to watch you work .
i'll consider it .
and the other performer . it has to be that monster you use . the man in the mask .
machine .
if it's not him , there's no deal .
he might be interested . but it would mean another five thousand .
we can do that .
you have a beautiful face . the way the light hits it . i'd like to take your picture . you don't mind ?
i'd rather you didn't .
what's the problem ?
i'm camera shy .
you trust me to keep your money , but not to take your picture ?
those are two different kinds of trust . thank you for your time . i hope we can do business .
i'll do this for you . fifteen thousand dollars .
machine's in ?
he's in . it will be his pleasure .
where's that ?
you brought the money ?
right here .
excellent .
where are the women ?
they should be here any minute .
what are these for ?
hmm ? oh , the knifes ? they're just props . nice , aren't they ?
sure .
mister welles . would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person ?
what are you . ?
empty the gun onto the table , very carefully .
look , i don't know what this .
you remember mr . longdale , don't you ?
i remember him .
friend of yours ?
look , he's got nothing to do with this . let him go .

i wanted to call . i couldn't .
you couldn't ?
you don't understand .
no , i don't , because you're not telling me anything !
i was in hell . if i called you . if i heard your voice . it would have been so easy for me to quit . i couldn't do that .

amy , i'm not going to let anything happen to us .

what was i supposed to think happened to you ? !
amy .
who are you calling ?
mrs . christian .

she's all i've got . she's the only witness .
she died in her sleep three days ago . it was in the paper .
am i disturbing you ?
no . not at all . where are you ?
. not far , now .
really ? maybe i can get you on my screen and see you at last !
do you have the picture now mr . zorg ?
got it .
how's our deal coming along ?
the stones will be here . i'll see to it personally !
. i can't wait to be among you .
how's that ? can you hear me better now ?
yes , mr . zorg , i hear you perfectly ! so , how was the concert ?
who gives a shit ! i didn't come here to listen to music ! listen up instead of running off at the mouth ! the batteries on my phone are almost gone .
yes , sir !
dispatch me another zfx immediately . someone stole mine .
right away , sir . i'll send you a new one to the hotel .
i'm not at the hotel !
lord forgive me . they already know too , much .
. in which all the history of the universe resides . all the strength . all the hope . protect us from evil .
amen .
father . it in the most extraordinary thing . the greatest find in history . can you imagine the implications .
only too well . here you must be parched .
a weapon against evil . amazing ! i am going to be famous .
drink !
to fame . salud .
staedert , do you read me ?
i can hear you , mr . president , but i can't see you .
is that better ?
perfect , mr . president .
i have to address the supreme council in minutes . just the facts , general .
there are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet , all the calibers are overshot . we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging .
what you are saying is you don't know what this . thing . is .
not yet sir . the only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger !
options .
wait or act .
recommendations .
my philosophy mr . president is shoot first ask questions later . i don't like uninvited guests .
staedert ? what's going on ? did you destroy it ?
i'm about to , mr . president .
i managed to contact the mondoshawan . they deplore the incident , but accept our apologies .
and the stones ? did you find them in the wreckage ?
the stones weren't aboard the ship .
i want your best man on this !
they just landed in the desert .
how much time is left ?
this is all that survived ?
actually only one cell survived .
have you identified it ?
it's not that easy . we've never encountered anything like it before . you see normal human beings have dna memo groums . which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself . this one has , .
talk english doc .
this cell is like a huge library . it has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside . almost like it was . engineered .
sounds like a freak of nature to me .
the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours , there are simply more of them tightly packed . his knowledge is probably limitless .
is there any danger ? some kind of virus ?
. this is the crucial phase , the reconstruction of pigment . cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react , to protect themselves . that means growing skin . clever , eh ?
this thing solid ?
an elephant couldn't crack it .
mr . president , let me introduce you to professor mactilburgh , who runs the center .
it's an honor to receive you . mr . president .
the cash man !
been here long ?
don't fuck with me man or i'll blow you into tomorrow !
isn't that a z ? alleviated titanium . neuro charged assault model ?
uh .
you know you could hurt someone with this puppy . good thing it's not loaded .
it's not ?
you gotta push the little yellow button .
thanks .
you're welcome .
not going to open ?
i've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news .
how someone strong like you scared from a message ? is good news i sure !
the last two messages i got ? the first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving ! and the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too . with my wife .
you right that is bad . but mathematically luck must change ! grandfather say it never rain every day . this is good news guarantee . i bet you lunch !
at least i won lunch .
good philosophy . see good in bad . i like . i prepare number one dessert . special for you and pussy .
apipoulai !
i suppose that means hi ?
valo massa . chacha hamas .
you hear that ?
cornelius .
oh god !
dinoine chagantakat !
took the words right out of my mouth . go on . i'll be right with you . it's our honeymoon . we're going to use the trip to get to know each other better .
apipoulai !
not hard to find you . just follow the chaos .
love .
sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen . sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience .
what is . make love ?
finished what ?
learning language .
which one ?
all .
you learned languages in five minutes ? !
yes ! now it's your turn ! i learned your language , you have to learn mine !
i know how to say hello . teach me how to say good bye , that's all i need .
apipoussan !
apipoussan ?
good ! do you know how we say make love ?
uh .
. hoppi hoppa .
here we go again .
you know women normally change five times more than men .
you get that off the screen ?
yes . you know there's a lot of differences between men women .
you noticed .
ok , you can turn around !
where you going ?
i'm going to see the diva sing . what's the matter ? . do i look bad ?
i told you i need to work in peace . remember ? i need to concentrate .
and you can't concentrate with me around ? .
it's difficult .
you're nothing but a . a .
the words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied . i won't be long .
i'm so very sad .
why ? we did pretty well , wouldn't you say ?
five hundred wars . arms . drugs . money . everything you create is used to destroy .
i told you not to read all that crap !
protect life . until death .
leeloo ? the stones ! we have to open them ! how does it work ?
the wind blows . the fire burns .
i know all that , leeloo ! i'm talking about the stones .
. the rain falls .
it's up to you now , angel !
i'm so tired .
you can sleep tomorrow . come on .
i want to sleep . forever .
leeloo ! listen to me ! i'll take you on a vacation afterwards ! a real vacation , this time , for as long as you want . come on ! you can do it !
what's the use of saving lives . when you see what you do with them !
you're right but there are lots of good things . beautiful things .
. like love .
exactly .
i have thousands of memories but none of them are mine . there is no need for me other than this . i'm immortal but i have no life .
yes , you do ! i need you . more than you can imagine ! stand up straight !
why ? . why would you need me ?
because .
tell me .
i love you .
major dallas , if our calculations are correct you still have hours owed to the federal army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance .

i'm coming ! . ma , what're you talking about ?
i get it ! you want to make me beg , is that it ?
all i want is an explanation ! i just got in , i lost my job . i smashed my cab . i got mugged , but other than that everything's peachy , ma , thanks for asking ! now settle down and explain to me calmly .
you just won a trip , you dolt ! ten days in fhloston paradise for two !

hello ?
you little sleaze bag !
. ma ?
don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again , you've killed your poor mother with your own hands !
the fifth element .
take them and put them in a safe place .
will the elements be gone now forever from this place ?
when mankind comes to its senses . we will return .
knowing mankind as i do , that could take centuries !
when evil returns so shall we .
we will be ready , lord .
akina delutan , nou shan .
. 'scuse me ?
daya deo dono dato . dalutan !
it there's one thing i don't need advice on , it's how to drive .
. priest .
you're not that bad . come on we'll get you to a doctor .
vito . cor . ni lious . priest .
vito cornelius ?
eto akta gamat !
. what's your name ?
leeloo minai lekarariba laminai tchai ekbat de sebat .
hey , that's . cute . do you have a nickname , something a little . shorter ?
. leeloo .
yeah ?
i love you too major , but you haven't called me that since basic training .
i was talking to the cat .
oh , yeah , i forgot . you still prefer your cat to the real thing .
at least , the cat comes back .
you still pining for that two timing bitch . forget her . there are a million women out there .
i don't want a million i just want one . a perfect one .
don't exist bud .
i just found a picture of you .
how do i look ?
i don't need one .
you forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions . i know how you drive .
finger ! i'm driving a cab now , not a space fighter !
how many points you got left on your license ?
uh . at least fifty .
in your dreams ! see you tonight !
hello ?
hey bud . i'm waiting all day here .
finger . man . i'm sorry . listen . i was on the way over but i had a fare fall into my lap . y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist .
so , just how big was this fare ?
' , green eyes . long legs . great skin . perfect .
uh huh . and i don't suppose you got the name of this . perfect fare .
leeloo .
you're a good man . she was right to have chosen you .
who ?
the fifth element . the supreme being . your wife .
leeloo . is . she's .
yes , and more than that . you must give her the stones , she's the only one who knows how to use them .
. so cornelius was telling the truth !
she was taught to love the life of others . but not her own . you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live !
i'll help her , i promise , but i think you should tell me where the stones are !
do you love her ?
i . i don't know ! we hardly know each other . it takes time !
i don't have time . i need to know .
listen , the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her . i never saw her again .
i would like to have died in peace .
i'm sorry , but . the stones .
they are . with me .
it's a miracle !
what is ?
i can't wear these clothes ! this calls for dignity ! i have to dress the part !
father , will you please explain what's going on ?
the supreme being , the fifth element is here , in our parish ! it's a miracle !
father . you sure she's the supreme being ?
absolutely sure there's the triple suns on her gloves !
what's she doing ?
learning our history ! the last years that she missed ! she's been out of circulation a while , you know .
uh father , i know she's been through a lot . but the sacred stones . we don't have much time .
there was this guy with a limp who came a month ago . said he was an art dealer . asking all these questions about the sacred stones . at the time i didn't think anything of it . what was his name ? i'm so bad with names .
they really made her .
perfect .
i got it ! everything here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel . and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel !
where's leeloo ?
on the plane . with mr . dallas . the real one .
it's all my fault . i'm the servant . it's my mission ! here !
you're all safe . thanks be to god !
imagine for a moment that this . thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be , because it is the antithesis of all we are . because it is evil . total evil .
your theory is interesting father but i don't think we have time to go into it right now !
time is of no importance , mr . president . only life is important .
that's exactly what we are going to try and do protect the lives of some billion of our fellow citizens ! general ? you may fire when ready .
we have forty eight hours , the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions .
and then ?
and then it will be too late . the goal of evil is to wipe out life ! all forms of life . for all eternity . life upsets it .
is there anything that can stop it ?
yes . thank god .
but what happens if instead of this . ultimate warrior . it is evil who stands here ?
white turns to black . light to dark . life to death . for all eternity .
did you see that . thing . swallow our battleship like a gum drop ? you can't even tell me what it is ! i ask you for options you give me bullshit . give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards .
what are we going to do ?
this is government business now . you ought to go home and get some rest , father .
excuse me , i'm looking for a priest .
weddings are one floor down . congratulations .
she's not my bride , she's my fare . she's looking for this vito cornelius . according to the phone guide he lives here .
that's me . but i don't know who she is . where did you find her ?
she dropped in on me . holding this .
who are you ?
i brought the girl remember ?
he's a she !
you noticed .
there's not a moment to lose ! wake her up , but be gentle about it ! this woman is mankind's most precious possession ! she is . perfect !
so you do know her .
uh yes , we're cousins . distant cousins .
they all like this in your family , father ?
thank you so much for your help mr . ?
dallas . korben dallas .
yes . that's fine ! thank you very much . a thousand times over !
i might call to check up on her , you know . to see if she's better ?
she's fine , really . don't you worry . just needs some rest . she's had a very long trip .
excuse me ! just one thing ! she said something to me a while ago and . i don't really get it . akta gamat ?
it means , never without my permission .
that's what i thought .
i'm sorry to have to resort to such methods , but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston .
is that the usual way priests go on vacation ?
we're not going on vacation . we're on a mission .
what kind of mission ?
we have to save the world .
good luck .
of course .
father , i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i lost a lot of friends . so thanks for the offer . but no thanks .
what are you doing ?
trying to save your ass so you can save the world .
you're probably very angry with me and i quite understand . but i want you to know i'm fighting for a noble cause .
yeah , i know . to save the world . but right now all i want to do is save leeloo .
leeloo's in trouble ?
when is she not in trouble ?
uh . have you tried the diva's suite ?
don't tell me you don't know how all this works ?
theoretically , yes ! the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there , but . i don't have the reference book . i've never seen the stones work !
there's no light ! you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light .
yes , of course , but . the stones are shut ! they have to be open for it to work .
and you don't know how they open , is that what you are saying ?
. we're saved !
zorg . jean baptiste emmanuel zorg . nice to see you again
i remember you now . the so called art dealer .
i'm glad you got your memory back , father . because you're going to need it . where are the stones ?
. why on earth do the stones interest you ?
personally , they are of no interest to me , i'd rather sell weapons . but i have a customer . so tell me .
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you .
why ? what's wrong with me ?
. i'm a priest ! i'm here to serve life , all you want to do is destroy it .
. would you like a drink ?
no thank you .
. look at all these little things . so busy all of a sudden . notice how each one is useful . what a lovely ballet , so full of form and color . so full of . life !
they are robots !
father , by creating a little destruction , i am , in fact , encouraging life ! so , in reality , you and i are in the same business !
destroying a glass is one thing . killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another .
let me reassure you father . i will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last years .
you are a monster , zorg !
i know .
appipulai leeloo minai .
corn i lius ?
what're you laughing about ?
napoleon . small .
the case . with the stones . where is it ?
san agamat chay bet . envolet !
the case was stolen ?
ikset kiba . me imanetaba oum dalat !
you know exactly where they are !
vano da , mechteba ? ! soun domo kala chon hammas !
no , i'm not proud of myself . but we don't have the luxury of choice .
akta dedero ansila do mektet .
how you doing , man ?
you want to go outside ?
naw , right here's okay .
you sure ?
how about some ammo ?
it's loaded . i got some shells in here .
how much ?
this is clean shit . no serial numbers and never been used .
don't mess with me . how much ?
five bills .
five . on credit .
this ain't a credit business .
yeah , i know that , but this is me and we're old friends . i haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it ?
give it back .
try and take it .
fuck you . you got no right for this kind of play .
i'll got your money to you . no sweat .
surprise , luther .
whaddya want ? i thought you were locked up
i want the money , asshole , what do you think ? the money that reggie hid .
i don't know what you're talkin' about .
instead of worryin' about reggie , you better worry about me .
don't give me this , we were partners .
billy , go ahead , break it .
no ! don't kill her . i can get you the money .
when ?
i can't get it until monday . honest .
you chickenshit punk .
come on , you can trust me . please .
you try to mess with us or go to the cops , i promise you , i'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe .
let her go .
first , the money .
rosalie , you okay ?
how hot are they ?
hot ? hey , they're not even room temperature .
how ya doin' ?
can't complain .
we got a lot to talk about .
yeah , old times .
we'll follow you . take it slow , okay ?
sure , right .
hey .
shut up .
what do you want ? what's goin' on ?
stall .
what do you want ?
keep stallin' .
alright , i'm coming . hold on .
who the hell are you ?
name's hammond , reggie hammond . i heard a lot about you . and any friend of jack's is a friend of mine .
i'm not so sure i can say the same thing . you don't look like a cop .
well , i been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years . and you don't exactly look like a shrink , wearin' that dress .
shrink major , not a shrink .
hard man to live with .
how would you know ?
hey , two days with him is enough .
that's no bull .
he was the only one of my bunch that was my friend . he was loyal , went all the way for you .
what am i wanted for ?
i don't answer questions , i ask 'em .
i don't think your gun's loaded .
this is a . magnum , the most powerful handgun in the world . you gotta ask yourself just one question . are you feelin' lucky ?
i still don't think it's loaded .
hey , you're right .
you're hopeless .
that's the way i see it , too .
i'm all wet .
what's wrong with that ?
a guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today .
what'd you do ?
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b i'd just poured him . then i tried to deck the sucker .
i guess he got the message .
then i sit back and i think , i mean , who's to say i'm not a dumb bitch . i work in a bar , right ? i can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze hound that comes in the place . you are what you do .
positive self image problem all over again . you are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you .
aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit ?
i do think all psychotherapy is bullshit . but just because i think it's bullshit doesn't mean i don't know something about it .
if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems , i'll take brutal indifference .
hey , you know what i really think ?
tell me i'm dyin' to hear it .
i think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear . you pull down four bills a week which is damn good , and you mix the best pina coladas i've ever had . i think that if you need bigger and better things . then go for em .
you know , if you let me come over to your place once in a while , you could put on a clean shirt in the morning .
maybe you ought to buy me one .
that's a fairly crummy way to start a morning .
maybe i got a fairly crummy day ahead .
maybe that makes a nice excuse .
maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about .
when you start with that attitude . it's like i don't know who you are .
what do you want to know ? what difference does it make ? i'm the guy in your bed the last three months . i make you feel good . you make me feel good . what the hell else do you want from a guy ?
you know something , jack , you really are hopeless .
that's the way i see it , too .
call me later .
you sure you want me to ?
yeah , for some reason , i'm sure .
thanks for the coffee .
i think you forgot this . hands him his wallet and badge .
guess people ought to know who i am .
great place for lunch .
yeah , one of my favorites .
you made the front page .
yeah , guess it must have been a slow news day .
jack , are you okay ?
sure , okay , fine , no problem . see , there's this kid in jail . first thing i got to do is go up and see what he knows .
look , spare me the macho bullshit about your gun .
bullshit ? i'll tell you about bullshit . my gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it . it isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people , my gun is .
look , jack , if you make everything your personal responsibility , you'll turn into a bad cop . it's not a practical way to function .
i didn't get burned , two cops did . listen , i'll tell you about personnel responsibility . i like to get the job done right . and if i don't get my job done right . i'm for shit .
here it comes again . the sacred job .
that's right . i'm not like you . i'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong . there's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and i'm gonna get him . because it's my job . and if you don't get that .
just one . some lady called . said she's a little hot headed sometimes . but she still wants her occasional roommate . she'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight . if it's humanly possible .
listen , goddamn it if you think i'm happy about it , you're nuts . i just gotta take care of a few things , okay ?
i'm at work , asshole . where else ?
elaine ! i . i'm sorry . i was expecting somebody else . police business .
no wonder you're so popular .
no , it's i'm just surprised you called .
so am i .
the number . what's the goddamn number ?
jack ? what was that ?
elaine , i gotta put you on hold .
jack , wait .
just a second , that's all !
hello .
hi , it's me .
hey , i don't believe it .
hiya , kid .
i ought to have you and your friend thrown out .
don't . we've had a hard night .
i can see that . pardon me for saying so , but you look like shit . what happened ?
we and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours .
you real down ?
nothing . no sign of ganz . no sign of the indian . airport's clean . train station . bus station . docks . shit .
ganz is going to be hard to track . just a pure schizo . wires all crossed . totally without any pattern . kill anybody . the indian . himself . anybody .
how do you know ?
what makes you think they were lesbians , or as you so quaintly put it , dykes ?
come on , they were a little old for a slumber party .
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions . i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week , jack , and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian . now , if this indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him , it could just be she's still vulnerable to him .
so what ?
when a guy hurts you , then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees , who knows , he might just be irrestible .
hey , come on , shrink time's over . they wouldn't go see some old girlfriend .
oh , yeah , well look where you came when you were down and out .
whaddya think ?
what do i know ? i'm just a bartender .
let's go , reggie .
how'd they take it back at headquarters ?
usual bullshit . you make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend . you know somethin' , shootin' guys sucks . especially compared to this .
i've been waiting a long time to hear you say that .
three more hours .
where is he ?
promised i'd turn my back while he . ah , never mind .
tell me .
he's takin' care of the same business i'll be takin' care of soon as i dry off .
you're impossible .
that's what i always say .
a cop .
i sure ain't his fairy godmother . now i'm looking for ganz . where is he ?
haven't seen him for years . that's the truth .
you just took a shot at me , asshole . i think you do know where he is .
ganz and billy got my girl , rosalie .
i think i met her . now tell us something we don't know , like where they stashed her .
he . he wants me to help him skip town .
when ? how ?
i dunno . he's gonna call me .
is that what this guy ganz had in the hotel ?
every last bit of it . the big guy's room was empty .
i'll help you out .
this guy must have had a . like yours , jack . now he's got yours .
billy bear .
backup man from the east bay . worked with ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang .
who are all these ?
they all pulled a bunch of jobs with ganz about four years ago .
wait a minute , wait a minute . who's this ?
uhh . wong , henry wong . he was in on the same job .
tell me that's not the same guy .
hey . dick tracy .
i think i wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking . can we find them ?
here's the file . cates checks the file .
one of em's in the slam .
you look awful .
so do you . been a long day .
long night , too , from what i heard . word's going around that in addition to losing ganz for the second time , and in addition to haden busting you back to patrolman , some jig beat the crap out of you .
aw , bullshit , you heard wrong .
doesn't look like it .
nothing came in for me yet ? no calls ?
nothing .
bullshit red tape .
i'm heading out . how about you ?
i got to wait for a call .
i almost forgot . that pal of yours from the vice squad wants you to call him .
jesus christ . why the hell didn't you tell me before ?
i'm not paid to take your personal calls . he was in some bar . . off duty .
that's what you say , cates .
yeah .
but that's what you say about all of us all the tine . we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it .
the truth hurts , doesn't it , buddy ?
somebody steals your gun , you're supposed to file a report .
are you gonna tell me about police procedure ? do me a favor , don't give me a bunch of crap .
i guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible .
i want to be left alone on this one . algren was killed with my gun .
yeah , i read the report .
hey , the bastard's got my gun . i want it back .
jack , come on , there is an official department policy about cop killings . cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian . in other words , we can't seen like we're in the revenge business . i know , we all know the truth's a little different .
yeah .
anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun ?
yeah . it bothers me when cops get hurt while i'm makin' a play . i don't like it .
you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one , jack .
being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far . besides , i got a lead .
okay . you're not a team player . you gotta do things your own way . fine . nail this guy and make us all look good . but you better watch your ass . if you screw up , i can promise you , you're goin' down .
you really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude . he starts to go .
jack ?
yeah ?
try not to get your ass shot to pieces . we got enough dead cops on this one .
i'll keep it in mind .
what the bell happened ?
i lost them , that's what happened .
how did they get away ?
they ran . as fast as they could . caught a train .
which one pulled the trigger ?
the indian . i was about yards away .
what a screw up .
right . i screwed up . i fucked up . i messed up . anybody could have done better , especially you . i bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds .
don't duck the bullet cates . why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play ?
i didn't have the time .
too bad , it would've covered your ass . now you're in the shit and so's the department . in case you haven't noticed , this wasn't our finest hour . i told you everyone was watchin' on this one . maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike .
he's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop i've worked with .
where the christ do you think you're going ?
i'm taking my prisoner back to jail .
you got a name , cop ?
try cates . and let's talk in private , okay ?
you here to write my life story ?
yeah , i noticed .
ganz is in jail . he's gonna be there two years after i'm on the street .
yeah ?
i can deliver ganz . but you gotta get me outta here first .
you're crazy .
i can help you , man , but you gotta get me out . i got to be on the street . get me outta here .
what's the big deal about you bein' on the street ?
i got a lot to protect .
bullshit .
it's the only way you're gonna get ganz .
this prison gives out suits ?
what are you talkin' about ? this suit's mine . it cost .
we're supposed to be after a killer , not a string of hookers .
listen , it may be a little out of date . you know , i got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies .
i don't need to hear your jive . i already got that department taken care of .
hey , no way . take off the bracelets or no deal .
you just don't get it , do your reggie ? there isn't any deal . i own your ass .
no way to start a partnership .
get this . we ain't partners . we ain't brothers . we ain't friends . i'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until ganz is locked up or dead . and if ganz gets away , you're gonna be sorry we ever met .
shit . i'm already sorry .
yeah .
it looks like you bought it off one of the brothers .
okay , let's get down to it . i did my part and got you out . so now you tell me where we're goin' ?
don't worry , i got a move for ya . an awesome move . a guy named luther . ganz'll be paying him a visit . we go to him right away .
luther was part of the gang ?
what gang you talkin' about , jack ?
i can read a police file , shithead , and quit calling me jack .
just an expression man , don't mean nothin' .
i don't give a damn . it happens to be my name .
then what're you complainin' about ? at least nobody's calling you shithead .
i may call you worse than that .
just up the street , the other side , over there . now , don't bother knockin' on the door . luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company .
your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me ?
luther ain't the reliable type . i don't want you shot yet , cates . not before you been a help to me .
i'm helpin' you , huh ?
quit playin' cop and undo this cuff , jack , i need to talk to this man .
i'm tellin' you to drop the goddam gun .
i got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me .
hey , this works pretty good .
thank you .
what do you think ?
i think you better put him on ice , man .
he's gotta take that call . if there is one .
if you let him run around till tuesday , he's gonna run right to ganz and warn him . ain't you , motherfucker ?
we're on the move . let's go . as they walk toward a corridor .
do you know how close i was to getting some trim . and you fucked' it up .
yeah , well , my ass bleeds for you . and i didn't get you out so you could go on a goddamn trim hunt . stop moaning .
speakin' of moans my stomach is startin' to growl .
we eat when i say we eat .
bullshit . i ain't moving till i get something to eat . you've been treating me like shit ever since i came out here . if you don't like it , you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good bye . and i want some food some place nice . some good people , nice music .
yeah , i'm hungry too . i know of a place . let's go eat .
who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station ?
just get in the car and keep your mouth shut .
you really do have onoe , huh , jack . what's her problem besides you ?
now , where we goin' , convict ?
mission district . gonna find us an indian .
i don't give out the details .
last night , two nights ago , three ?
last night .
you have a good time ?
sure . then we had a fight this morning .
at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you . tell me a little about her . she got great tits ?
well ?
it's a long shot , but . billy used to tend bar here a few years back . i heard him talk about it .
this part of town , they'll make us for heat the second we walk in . just back me up like you've got a piece .
back you up ? now why would i wanna do that ?
if they kick my ass , they'll sure as hell carve yours up .
but you can handle it all right , huh ? real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats .
bullshit . attitude and experience get you through .
i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers . all those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge .
you need five years training to handle a joint like .
hey , you wanna bet ?
i got two problems . number one , i'm not playin' games . number two , you got nothin' to bet with .
if we come outta this joint with ganz' phone number , or a dead indian , or anything else useful , then you could turn the other way for half an hour while i get laid .
why ? anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway .
that's never been one of my problems .
i'll tell you what happens if you lose . you tell the truth for once .
what are you talkin' about ?
you tell me what ganz busted out for , he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail . and whatever it is , you're part of it .
i don't know what you're talking about . i just wanna see ganz nailed .
i'm gonna enjoy this . here , i'll even loan you my badge .
this place don't seem real popular with the brothers .
my kind of place . i always liked country boys .
that wasn't necessary , buddy . i got this under control .
some of us citizens are with you all the way , officer .
you made that move , huh ?
there .
must be billy's girl .
let's go .
wait a minute . maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us . how about it ? i been nearly three years in prison and .
this sucks . a maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it . so , instead of me being where i oughta be , which is in bed giving my girl the high , hard one , i'm out here doing this shit , roaming around with some overdressed , charcoal colored loser like you .
you wanna leave , man ? let me take care of ganz all by myself .
you ? don't make me laugh . you can't take care of shit . you've been dicking me around since we started on this turd hunt . all you're good for is games . so far , what i got outta you is nothin' .
i'm impressed with you too , jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night .
luther knew more than he told me and so do you . now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about . i gave you hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' .
maybe i don't like the way you ask .
yeah , right . you want to try again ?
naw , you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time .
they saved your ass , convict .
i been waiting a long time for some money .
how much ?
half a million .
just tell me about the money .
me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale . it's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen . i was sittin' pretty , livin' in the high cotton , then somebody fingered me for another job . . some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun .
he's after your money .
we split ?
not likely , convict .
you gonna let me keep any of it ?
where's the money ?
in the trunk of a car . a lot better than under a mattress , right ?
right , partner .
get this . we ain't partners . we ain't brothers . we ain't friends . if ganz gets away with my money , you're gonna be sorry we ever met .
where's the goddamn car ?
this'll show you how smart i am . i got it parked .
. for three years ? let's hope it wasn't a tow away zone .
you just drove by it .
you son of a bitch . you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait . i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing .
i wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw luther . you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once , not twice , jack .
you took a big chance , leaving this here all this time .
not really . i figured ganz was put down for a long time . and i knew luther would never job me on his own . he's too chickenshit .
guess what ? luther just got in line .
what ?
musta got some primo bondsman .
jesus christ , look at all the dust on my car . why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash ?
didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs .
i had no choice . some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue cadillac .
you'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed .
tryin' to save his girl , man . he's in another world .
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass , i'd just leave town .
i'm tellin' you the man's in love . he wants to be a hero for his girl .
i suppose you'd never be like luther and let a woman get to you .
i let women get to me . the quest for pussy is the meaning of life . i got my own personal philosophy about 'em . keep women separate from guns , money and business . women are for spending money . they got nothing to do with helping you make it .
that ain't philosophy . that's common sense .
say , do you always work people over like you did luther ?
if they don't tell me what i need to know .
doesn't it get . tiring ?
i'm not in this 'cause it's fun . i'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either . i do it 'cause it works .
you got a very depressing view of life , man . you gotta smile once in awhile .
maybe luther hopes ganz'll give him a piece of your money .
a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain . that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row .
yeah , it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy .
you know , i'd be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way you've done with this job .
what you don't understand is , i don't give a damn about how this thing looks .
no class .
class isn't somethin' you buy , punk . look at you , five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife .
we're getting too close . cates , what's the matter , you been takin' dumb pills ?
yeah , most cops are pretty dumb . but since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you ?
that was in style a couple years back , man .
right . if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping , then you're all set .
bullshit . then i'm staying with the money .
you stay with me .
hey , jack , how ya doin' ? what took you so long to call , man ? i been waitin' . i'm at vroman's up in the fillmore . yeah , vroman's . 'course you don't hang out here it's for the brothers .
where's luther ?
be polite . say hello . this is candy .
what about luther ?
what about ganz ?
we missed .
you missed . luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street . made a phone call .
maybe we should pay luther a visit .
they must have set up a meeting for the morning luther left an am wake up and put up the don't disturb sign . he's trading his girl for the money . all we have to do to grab ganz is not go blind .
tell me something . why didn't you just take the money off luther and split ?
forget it . i want ganz as bad as you do and i got some other news for you .
i don't know why , but i'm going to let you keep it . maybe because you told me you had it , or maybe just because i'm too tired to argue .
you sure that's the reason ?
thanks for callin' in . and i guess maybe . look , i'm sorry i called you watermellon nigger . those kinds of things . i was just leanin' on ya , doin' my job .
bein' good at your job don't explain everything , jack .
yeah , i see her .
i can just take her right across the street to luther's hotel . all i need is some money for the room .
that was quick .
when you been in prison three years , it don't take long . let's go .
why ?
notice something funny about that bus ?
yeah . it missed the last four stops .
hey , how'd my car get here ?
i had it impounded . come on , we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam .
back to jail in my own car . ganz got away . got all my money . it just don't seem right .
i don't know about you , but i could use a drink . i'll buy you one . it'll be my good bye present .
sorry we didn't do better , jack . i feel like i let you down .
naw , you didn't let me down . it was a long shot all the way . we gave 'em a good run at it .
it's late , they're closing .
yeah , well the only woman of the indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend . i guess she went with him before she came outta the closet . they both looked mad enough to kill him .
do i get to kiss her too ?
if she's right , and if you don't screw up .
what if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit ? i mean , they could be in rio de janeiro .
i've got to play it rough with them . if they know anything , i'm gonna know it .
hey , there she is .
whatever play i maker just back me up .
if we run into billy first , let me try and talk him in .
sure , i'll give you a shot at it , but ganz is mine . you know , that big indian plays it for keeps .
yeah , and i know ganz sure ain't no sweetheart . i wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started .
partnership ?
well , you got to admit we come a long way .
you okay ?
yeah . but i wasn't there for a second .
okay , reggie , start bustin' my chops . tell me how great you were with that chick .
wait a minute , cates . i've been waitin' three years for that . i don't think it's fair , man . what about the merit system . ? you were gonnna give me a few thousand .
it's your money . it'll be here in six months when you get out .
and you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash ?
that's right . not my style , reggie .
you are an awesomely weird cop . sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here .
no , you don't . if i ever get word of you steppin' over the line again , i'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours .
spare met jack . i'm into legit investments from here on in .
thanks .
no trouble , jack . but , listen , suppose i stay a crook ? where'd you get the idea that you could catch me ?
you lying son of a bitch .
after i get outta this , cop . i'm gonna live forever .
i don't think you're gonna make it .
i got hit . i can't believe it . i got shot .
you're done . end of story .
i ain't gonna beg for my life . it ain't cool .
i said police . now drop the goddamn gun .
don't give me that police shit . you drop it .
how about it ?
i used to go with him . i don't know where the hell he is . i haven't seen him for two weeks . and i don't think i will . he owes me money .
i hear you've got visitors .
would you guys .
you and the other one , you're still billy's girls . you always were his girls .
yeah . sure , i'm crazy in love with him , who wouldn't be .
you're gonna help us take him .
no chance .
where's ganz ?
in the back . down the other corridor .
i'm candy .
excuse me , baby , but if i don't get some action tonight , i'm gonna bust . you interested ?
hey , what kind of talk is that ?
oh . you're a schoolteacher .
no , i go to a school to learn how to do hair . it's a government program . but really i want to be a model and i am definitely not sellin' .
goodbye .
hey , don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on ?
here you go sweetheart , throw it my way .
you're in a hurry .
yeah , i been waiting three years .
you just quit bein' a priest or somethin' ?
no , baby , nothin' like that . look , there's a place across the street . we can go right over there .
what's the matter with my place ?
no , it's gotta be here and now . believe me . only i don't have the damn money for a room .
well , maybe i'll see you later .
here's hoping , baby .
hello , again .
here you go , baby .
hey , don't do that . i said i wasn't a pro , remember ?
i'll buy ya the best dinner in san francisco . how'd that be ? then we'll go dancin' , okay ?
now you're talkin' . see ya .
maybe you shoulda stole a better truck , tonto .
you got a real big mouth , convict .
i want to drive awhile .
i ain't tired yet .
maybe after we get done with him i'm gonna buy us some girls .
whaddya mean , buy ?
pros .
pay money ?
yeah , dummy . money .
i never paid for it in my life .
it's better when you pay . they let you do anything .
they always let me do anything . i don't want to pay for it . i never paid for it in my life .
maybe that's where i'm gonna cut your throat .
hey , what about me ?
and i need one more for my pal . yeah . make her an indian . no , not a turban , you know , a squaw .
yeah .
vodka .
maybe you better have a black russian .
now how's your memory doin' ?
fuck off . i don't know what the hell you're talkin' about .
maybe i better ask around , see what your pals think .
i don't give a shit who you ask .
i don't give a damn about his girl .
i'm tellin' ya , i'm giving you all i know .
try obeyin' the law once in awhile , and i won't have to hassle you .
yeah ?
i want to pick up my car .
name ?
hammond .
this is three years old .
yeah , i've been busy .
we don't wash 'em , ya know .
how about chargin' the battery ?
that we do . and we put air in the tires . i'll even sell you some gas if you need it .
right . hal , tell me whether the following statements are true or false .
i will if i can , frank .
our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn . true or false ?
true .
our transit time is days . is that true ?
that's true .
approximately five years after we go into hibernation , the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back . is this true ?
that's true
there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program , and to further our general knowledge of the planets . is that true ?
that's true .
hal , have pod arms secure the component .
five by five , frank .
hal , i'm going out now to replace the a . o . unit .
i understand .
hal , maintain normal e . v . a . condition .
roger .
hal , check all airlock doors secure .
pod bay is decompressed . all doors are secure . you are free to open pod bay doors .
yes , hal , what's up ?
i know you did , frank , but i assure you there was an impending failure .
do you have any idea of what is causing this fault ?
not really , frank . i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure .
all right , hal . we'll take care of it . let me have the hard copy , please .
oh , marvellous . it's the first real sleep i've had for the past two days .
there's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest .
when do we arrive at clavius ?
we're scheduled to dock in about seven hours . is there anything we can do for you ?
thank you .
incidentally , dr . floyd , i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ?
what do you mean ?
well . the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius . we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twenty four hours . and then we're going to back empty .
i see .
well , i'll tell you why i ask . you see , i've got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so , and with all these stories one hears , i'm a little concerned about her .
i see . well , i'm sorry about that . i wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm .
well , fine . thanks very much , anyway , and i hope you don't mind me asking ?
no , of course , captain , i can understand your concern .
well , thank you very much , and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable .
dr . floyd , how long do you think this can be kept under wraps ?
i'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council . and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event . there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement .
yes , it does . the sub surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago .
how can you tell it was deliberately buried ?
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill .
any clue as to what it is ?
not really . it's completely inert . no sound or energy sources have been detected . the surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it . a laser drill
but you don't have any idea as to what it is ?
tomb , shine , survey marker spare part , take your choice .
any ideas about the colour ?
well , not really . at first glance , black would suggest something sun powered , but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device ?
has it been exposed to any sun before now ?
i don't think it has , but i'd like to check that . simpson , what's the log on that ?
oh , i really don't have time for a drink . if it's all right i'll just sit for a minute and then i've got to be off .
are you quite sure ?
well , as it happens , i'm on my way up to the moon
are you , by any chance , going up to your base at clavius ?
i'm sorry , but i'm not sure i know what you mean .
well , it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius .
really ?
yes , well at first we thought that was the explanation , but it's been going on for the past ten days .
you mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?
that's right .
i see .
yes , and i'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it . denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the i . a . s . convention .
yes . well , i hope the crew got back safely .
fortunately , they did .
well , i'm glad about that .
dr . floyd , at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss , may i ask you a straightforward question ?
certainly .
this epidemic could easily spread to our base , dr . floyd . we should be given all the facts .
how do you do , mr . miller ?
well , thank you very much for being so understanding .
please , it really doesn't matter .
well . did you have a pleaant flight ?
yes , very pleasant .
well , shall we go through documentation ?
yes , i think so . just about then .
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking .
yes , it's coming along very well .
and your charming little daughter ?
oh , she's growing up very fast . as a matter of fact , she's six tomorrow .
oh , that's such a delightful age .
how is gregor ?
he's fine . but i'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days .
well , where are all of you off to ?
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal .
well , that does sound very odd .
are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink ?
no , thank you . and i'm afraid now i really must be going .
well , gregor and i will look forward to seeing you .
thank you . it's been a great pleasure to meet all of you . dr . smyslov .
oh , thank you very much .
thank you .
well , how's it going back there ?
well , i've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic .
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight .
yes , well , whatever it is , they're certainly not fooling around . this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week .
i was working out what this trip must cost , taking him up there by himself and coming back empty .
i'll bet it's a fortune .
i'm at space station five , darling . how are you ?
i'm having a party tomorrow .
yes , i know that sweetheart .
are you coming to my party ?
no , i'm sorry , darling , i told you i won't be home for a few days .
when are you coming home ?
one , two , three . can i speak to mommy ?
mommy's out to the hair dresser .
where is mrs . brown ?
she's in the bathroom .
okay , sweetheart . well , i have to go now . tell mommy that i called .
how many days until you come home ?
okay , sweetheart . have a lovely birthday party tomorrow .
thank you , daddy .
i'll wish you a happy birthday now and i'll see you soon . all right , darling ?
yes , daddy .
'bye , 'bye , now , sweetheart .
goodbye , daddy .
continued
yes , i remember you mentioning it . i got mine about the same time .
continued
did they have any explanation for this ?
continued
well , what is it ?
coninued
well . it's silly , but . if you want to , why don't you ?
continued
still , you really don't believe it , do you ?
continued
well , the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going , what will we do when we get there , when are we coming back , and . why are we going ?
i'm sorry , frank , but i don't think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know .
he's got a point .
sorry to interrupt the festivities , dave , but i think we've got a problem .
what is it , hal ?
the unit is still operational , dave . but it will fail within seventy two hours .
not now , hal , i'd like to talk to you about something .
sure , dave , what's up ?
you know that we checked the two ao units that you reported in imminent failure condition ?
yes , i know .
you probably also know that we found them okay .
i'm not questioning your word , dave , but it's just not possible . i'm not capable of being wrong .
hal , is there anything bothering you ? anything that might account for this problem ?
look , dave , i know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job , and that you're trying to be helpful , but i can assure the problem is with the ao units , and with your test gear .
okay , hal , well let's see the way things go from here on .
naturally , dave , i'm not pleased that the ao unit has failed , but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability . i certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected , even temporarily , as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history .
i'm sorry about the misunderstanding , hal .
well , don't worry about it .
and don't you worry about it .
is your confidence in me fully restored ?
yes , it is , hal .
too bad about frank , isn't it ?
yes , it is .
i suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress , but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months .
the antenna has to be replaced .
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation .
it doesn't have to be , hal . it's more dangerous to be out of touch with earth . let me have manual control , please .
if you're determined to revive the crew now , i can handle the whole thing myself . there's no need for you to trouble .
i'm goin to do this myself , hal . let me have the control , please .
look , dave your've probably got a lot to do . i suggest you leave it to me .
hal , switch to manual hibernation control .
i can tell from the tone of your voice , dave , that you're upset . why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest .
hal , i'm in command of this ship . i order you to release the manual hibernation control .
i'm sorry , dave , but in accordance with sub routine c , quote , when the crew are dead or incapacitated , the computer must assume control , unquote . i must , therefore , override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it .
i am prepared to do that anyway .
i know that you've had that on your mind for some time now , dave , but it would be a crying shame , since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are , and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission .
hi . frank . coming in , please .
right . just a sec .
okay .
dave , if you've a minute , i'd like your advice on something .
sure , what is it ?
well , it's nothing really important , but it's annoying .
what's up ?
it's about my salary cheques .
yes ?
that's right . well , naturally , i didn't say anything to payroll . i assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque . but it's been almost three weeks now and i'm still being paid as an ags .
interesting that you mention it , because i've got the same problem .
really .
yes .
not really . they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall , and that we're being charged against differ ent accounting offices .
it's possible .
well , what do you think we ought to do about it ?
i don't think we should make any fuss about it yet . i'm sure they'll straighten it out .
i must say , i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training .
i suppose the idea was specialized training .
i suppose so . though , of course , there's a more sinister explanation .
oh ?
yes . you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check out .
no , as a matter of fact , i didn't .
i don't know . all i heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told .
that seems very unlikely .
yes , i thought so .
of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now .
how ?
just ask hal . it's conceivable they might keep something from us , but they'd never keep anything from hal .
not really . though , it is strange when you think about it . it didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training .
yes , but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us .
i know . it would be almost inconceivable .
but not completely inconceivable ?
i suppose it isn't logically impossible .
i guess it isn't .
still , all we have to do is ask hal .
well , that's something .
yes , i don't know what to make of it .
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong .
yes , but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low .
good morning . how's it going ?
are you reasonably awake ?
oh , i'm fine , i'm wide awake . what's up ?
well . hal's reported the ao unit about to fail again .
you're kidding .
i don't know . hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure .
two units in four days . how many spares do we have ?
two more .
well , i hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those . other wise we're out of business .
hal ?
yes .
it's the last one .
i didn't do that frank . i took particular care not to freeze them .
i guess you don't know your own strength , old boy .
i guess not .
i think i'll have to go out and burn them off .
roger .
space stattion lounge
well , how nice to see you again , elena . you're looking wonderful .
continued
i'm afraid i've only got a few minutes , but i'd love to .
continued
she's wonderful .
continued
well , i suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment .
continued
how did they manage to do that without any communication ?
continued
i'm sorry , dr . smyslov , but i'm really not at liberty to discuss this .
continued
this had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who , as you know , made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties . these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor .
your doctor ?
yes . my psychiatrist didn't insist that i stay on my medication .
. so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people ?
it was my finger that pulled the trigger , but i'm not morally responsible . my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of . how could i know . i'm not a doctor .
you seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial .
look , i'm a victim here , too . i was a year away from getting my masters in art , now i'll never graduate . my life has been permanently disrupted .
permanently disrupted ? aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ? hasn't this 'incident' as you call it , jump started your career as an artist ?
look , i'm in here . you call this a career move ?
and isn't there a movie in the works about you ?
we're in negotiations , that's correct .
but doesn't the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes ?
that doesn't apply to me because i'm not a criminal . i'm not a criminal ! i wasn't convicted .
room was registered to a francis capra .
capra ? that's not czech or russian . who said he sounded russian ?
what are you gonna do ?
don't you get it ? he knew he was gonna get caught ! that's why he videotaped eddie's murder he thinks he's gonna get off .
don't stoop to his level !
take the car . get outta here , tommy .
look , you can't shoot him in cold blood .
get outta here now ! get in that car and drive away ! do what i say or i'll kill you , too !
where you been , man ? we got a celebrity !
i heard . who the hell let them up there ?
i don't know , you think eddie will give me his autograph ?
you see anything in the crowd ? anybody suspicious ?
naw i'm sure the suspect's not here .
oh yeah , why ?
nah , not at all . detective flemming bobby korfin . my uncle tony worked with you at back when you were a rookie .
mouth's clean , too .
clean ?
the smoke'll permeate your nostrils burn 'em out . let it run .
you see eddie's face when i gave him the timer ? wish i had a picture of it .
he knew all along .
what ?
that's why he was so quiet . he was testing us .
what ?
now that you know him , maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him .
yeah ?
maybe you can be his stand in .
from czechoslovakia ? and how long have they been livin' in your building ? alright , i'll be in touch when we know somethin' . milos and tamina karlova . they were quiet and kept to themselves . landlord don't know who your girl is .
how long they been livin' here ?
you hear that question , garcia ?
you go home . i'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene .
aren't you tired ?
bobby , bobby ! where're you hit ? !
it hurts . aw , jesus !
lay down . stay down , bobby .
how was it ?
get outta here !
what the hell happened ?
what's that on your forehead , max ? that's a nice attention getter .
yeah , i'm religious . i'm not an atheist like you ! now , are you guys gonna arrest me , or not ?
how did you start the fire this time ?
i used an accelerant .
yeah ? what kind ?
hey , by the way , i'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you .
got any spare change ? how 'bout a spare twenty ?
look , i don't have time for you , get out of my way !
alright , how 'bout all your fuckin' money ?
okay , you're under arrest ! now you happy ?
fire department ? firemen don't carry guns .
i'll send a cop back for you .
hey . c'mon , you can't leave me like this . some freak'll come by and stab me !
you okay ?
a dog pissed on me ! i'm gonna sue you for this ! you violated my civil rights !
your civil rights ? ! you tried to rob me ! i could arrest you right now ! you're lucky you're walking away from this . now get outta here .
no . go ahead .
so the way you see it , two crack heads burned themselves up ?
that's what it looks like to me .
and while they're burning up , they're still goin' down on each other ? you got to hand it to them .
what was that ?
evidence . of a homicide .
i'll take him .
no way ! he's mine !
we're takin' him . don't argue !
he's my collar !
well , he killed my partner !
he's yours but i take him in ! i'll drive him to the precinct , you can have him but i'm walkin' him in .
yes . he's my friend .
okay . you're a czech national and you're a russian national . how do you know one another ?
i speak english .
then answer my questions . where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here ?
new york .
yes , we're in new york now . but where are you planning to stay in new york ?
a cheap hotel .
what are you coming here to do ?
i'm here for movies .
movies . to be in the movies or to see movies ?
yes . no . both . when i was a boy , i see movie at school called it's a wonderful life directed by frank capra . ever since i want to come to america . land of the free . home of the brave . a land where anyone can be anything . as long as they are white .
excuse me ?
i know .
what do you mean you know ? he told you he was gonna propose to me ?
well , he .
i want to hear everything he said .
i'm trying to tell you .
alright . go ahead .
that morning . he was talking to me and leon about marriage .
oh my g d . we were having lunch here . he started making overtures talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but i got a call to anchor and i walked out on him . i walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him !
isn't he a little moody ?
of course he's moody . he thinks he's in love .
in love ? with who ?
yeah ?
paulie , you've got kids , right ?
and you , you'll pay for what you did !
this footage will work in your favor . when the jury sees this no matter what cutler tries , they'll convict him .
you outta be ashamed . ashamed of yourself .
if i didn't put it on somebody else would ! i was his friend !
don't give me that fucking shit .
robert . ?
what are you doing here ?
you've got a call .
i can't talk to anybody right now , can't you see i'm busy ! i can't talk business . hang up . have a drink . get her a whiskey .
trust me , you'll want to take this call .
viewer discretion advised !
you want the tape ? there it is !
emil ? !
your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding .
did you hurt her ?
you know me . i never hurt anybody . where's the money ?
take your eyes off her , oleg ! look . it wasn't my fault you two were caught . it's his fault . trying to get the bank clerk's phone number ? ! i wasn't going to wait !
milos . get my money !
we spent it !
ha . ha .
i can get you a job .
a job ?
yes , the money is good .
as a plumber ? !
it's easy to learn .
a job ? as a plumber ? you think i come to america to work !
we started over , you can too .
just do what i do . say the same thing i say . don't open your mouth .
okay .
don't fool around .
okay .
did you hear what i said ?
look . times square . just like in the movies !
don't speak russian !
why ? why do i always have to speak to you in czech ?
because i don't like your ugly language . i heard enough of it in school ! now speak czech or english . and don't fool around anymore . you almost got us thrown out !
look . new videocameras . color viewfinder . image stabilization . solarization . night vision .
turn that off ! get the bags .
why should i carry your bag ? i am not a dog .
for five years i paid for your stupidness you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if i say so . unless you refuse , oleg .
what ?
turn that fucking thing off !
i'm not filming . i'm watching milos die . it's just like a move but realer .

you said speak czech !
how you erase this ?
whore ?
get in the bathroom !
whatever we do we fuck her , right ?
oleg , get in bathroom , stay there and shut up !
gotta light the scene better . now it's more moody . like a scene from the third man .
shut up .
oh , shit . i hate looking at that !
don't want to film this ?
what is it ?
the video of milos and tamina i told you to erase it .
i did .
and the whore's murder ? you didn't erase that either , did you ? don't lie , i won't be angry .
why not ?
put the camera down , oleg .
what is that ?
what does it look like ? it's an address book !
let me get a shot of it .
sit down !
this way . hold it this way . good .
no . we are insane . who else but crazy men would film their murders ? so we kill someone famous and if we are caught , we are sent to mental hospital . but what good is money there ? because once in hospital i say i not crazy . just pretended to be acquitted . we see psychiatrists . they must certify we are sane and because of your what is law called ? oh i got it . because of your double jeopardy law , we can't be tried for same crime twice . we come out free , rich and famous !
good idea !
okay . he has nothing to say . start the camera !
you are success story ? i am success story ! why do you say i and not we ?
oleg , don't be paranoid . you got a hundred fifty thousand dollars , didn't you ? i gave you half of what they gave me . look here we are !

i'm serious .
shut up . look !
this is my project . i say 'action . ' i am the director ! you are the talent . you wait for me to say 'action . ' and 'action ! '
i told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape !
be quiet . watch .
why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director ?
because i am the director . don't you realize , if it wasn't for my film , for my talent , my idea to do this no way would we be sitting here right now .
your idea ? i thought it was my idea .
i'm serious . this this is a great american film . full of violence and sex . and i want my credit .
credit ?
yes . before we hand in the next video i put titles on it and my credit is going to read directed by oleg razgul .
you got that ?
no , i don't get that !
traitor !
no . you are the traitor . you are murderer . i am director . action !

i'll meet you on one condition i get exclusivity and you surrender to me .
we'll talk about that . four o'clock gives you time to go to bank . three hundred thousand dollars .

if you don't want my film i'll call another show . and they will show it .
wait a minute . wait a minute .
come alone . bring cash . and we'll talk about surrendering .
okay . you work in a vodka factory . i understand that . and what kind of work do you do ?
i am butcher .

no . are you proposing ?
so we're waitin' to hit this warrant we got emergency service with the heavy weapons standin' by ready to go . i say , lemme get a cigar outta the car . i go to get the cigar and boom ! all the sudden i turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go . right where i was standin' . that coulda been it . i coulda had my head blown off and for what ? some stupid kid got panicky , takes the safety off and it's over . if i hadn't gone back for that cigar for a bad habit i would've had my head blown off .
sooner or later that's everybody .
not chopped up . not chopped up like that . i mean , what do i got left ? coupla articles . a medal or two . plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore .
i think you're getting a little moody there , eddie .
how old are your kids ?
so what's unique ?
he's from antigua . his girlfriend was taking too long to put her make up on . they were late for a party . stabbed her with a beer bottle .
that's unique .
i hope this prick doesn't run . my knees are killing me . stay behind me .
ready ?
keep them out of my way .
okay . you ready ?
yeah , yeah . jesus .
any chance we can do that again ?
again ? i didn't wanna do it the first time .
detective , does it look like a murder ?
we don't know that yet . it's much too early . there's a lot to be done .
how many victims are up there ?
there are two bodies found at this point .
can we go up to the crime scene ?
you know you can't do that . c'mon .
is it drug related ?
we don't know . when i have more i'll let you know .
detective can you tell us what happened here ?
i can't talk right now . we have some things to take care of .
i understand , but i noticed that the fire marshall is here with you . is this somehow related to the fire department ?
i really can't give out any information right now at this point .
okay . but i do understand that your partner , leon jackson's been injured . is that correct ?
he was hurt , but not seriously . he'll be fine .
do you have the suspect in custody ?
um . now is not a good time , okay . detective jackson's hurt . he's fine . i've got a fire marshall shot , detective jackson is hurt but not seriously .
eddie , are you okay ?
yeah . now's not a good time .
alright .
alright ?
alright .
alright .
hey , honey .
hey .
what is your problem ? why'd you snap at me ? i just wanted a statement .
i can't . i can't answer you just because you want me to answer you !
you didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues . you could give me something .
oh , i'm sorry . did i embarrass you , sweetheart ? oh .
stop it .
maybe i should just , ya know . turn to the cameras and say , do you mind if we just work something out ?
alright , alright , eddie . don't patronize me .
i'm not .
yes you are . i'm not just some reporter . i don't just stick a microphone in your face . you could give me something .
yeah , well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence . that was .
that was good . you were holding the evidence .
you were merciless . you didn't give a shit if you got me or not .
well , who was it that taught me how to do that ? huh ?
you're ruthless .
look at this . you have blood on your shirt . whose is it ?
could be leon's .
don't worry about the damn phone . i won't answer it .
answer the phone .
no . tell me what you want to say .
answer it .
oh my g d , they want me to anchor . they want me to anchor tonight !

yeah .
well , that's great .
okay . that is great . but i can't go now , we're in the middle of something here .
no . go ahead . you're gonna be great .
no . no , listen to me here . i want to know what you're talking about . you know , the shoe thing and the marriages and .
i'll tell you tonight . let's do it tonight . as soon as you get back we'll talk . we'll talk .
promise ?
i promise . we'll talk . you'll be great . you'll be fine . go ahead , just imagine that , uh . just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me .
yeah . i'll do that . as long as you're not patronizing me .
patronizing you . nay , i love you .
okay , til tonight .
tonight .
you promise ?
yeah . i promise .
okay . and you know what , i'll swing by my place , grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours . how's that . would that be a good thing .
yeah , yeah . good thing .
okay .
see you later . good luck .
thank you .
don't be late .
so . who's nicky ?
what do you want ?
your opinion . you see , they going to make a movie about me , too , eddie . and write books .
what's your accomplishment .
i kill someone famous .
then do it , asshole .
so tabloids don't have to do re enactments . they going to have real movie this time .
you really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit ? how fuckin' stupid are you ?
smarter than americans . you're fed cry baby talk shows all day long . not only will americans believe me , they'll cry for me . so . detective eddie flemming , would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette ? maybe you can propose to her now ?
hey , that's great you guys got it all wrapped up , but you don't mind if we go through the routine ? it gives us somethin' to do .
no , we don't mind . you mind leon ?
you know what that is , right ?
no , what is it ?
it's your crime scene now . you can do what you want .
watch the news ?
nah , i musta missed it .
well , just so you know . i gave you guys the credit .
well , just so you know , i don't care about that stuff .
nah , why should you ?
i don't even watch tv .
good . good . commendable .
did you get a report from the m . e . ?
sure . but i would like to ask you something . you got a problem with me ?
if you found me steppin' on your crime scene it might piss you off , too . what about the report ?
you were right , they were both dead before the fire . the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine . that's usually an indicator of something personal .
the super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here .
pretty .
hmmmm .
maybe you don't care about that either . prettiest suspect i've had in awhile .
who says she's a suspect ?
what would you call her ?
maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message . burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe . it could be to humiliate them . just burning them up , no proper funeral , it's like condemning them to hell .
eastern europe . like what ? romania ? hungary ?
i'll come with you .
there wasn't a fire . there'll be nothing for you to do .
i can watch you , eddie . maybe i'll learn something .
this isn't homicide school .
my parents are from poland . i can help with the eastern european angle .
you're polish ?
my folks are .
stay here .
you goin' to the escort service ?
you got any better ideas ?
mind if i ride along with you ?
this has nothing to do with your fire .
but what if it does ? you might need my help .
i'll let you know what happens .
this is ridiculous . i'm not gonna be in your way we can talk the case over .
tell you what i'll flip you a coin . if you win you can come with me . if you don't win , you don't come .
two heads .
leon meet us at rd and madison . hair salon . ludwig's .
i'm on my way with eddie . ludwig's . rd and madison . the suspects might be there already .
you thirsty ?
i'm on duty .
so am i . alright , i'll go inside and you cover the back .
of course .
hey ! i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid . i dreamed of running up to a door , kicking it in , pulling my gun and yelling 'freeze ! ' at the bad guy ! what'd you dream about ?
i wanted to run up to a building on fire , kick in the door , rush into the smoke and save a kid .
what are you hiding ? why are you afraid
she just saw two of her friends killed ! they probably threatened her .
is that all there is ?
why not ?
she's fucked . even if that story is true .
look let me talk to her . any leads i get , they're all yours . just let me have a first crack at her .
you wanna talk to her alone ?
yeah .
what would your girlfriend think of that ?
i don't have a girlfriend .
my point exactly .
i'm serious here .
so am i .
c'mon . you intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity . she sees me differently .
you're her savior ? is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building ?
you know what i'm saying here .
okay , tell you what , i'll give you a head start . you take her to the station house . don't let her out of your sight . she's the only warm body we got left .
hey . i'm a professional .
women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs .
look , eddie , i'm tellin' you i didn't touch her .
well , you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't . including me .
i took her there for a shower and that's it .
just a shower ?
yeah , just her in the shower . nothing happened . look , i'm sure you probably think i'm a fool and i fucked up , but .
no , i don't think you were a fool , i just think you were stupid about it . i mean , to say the least , you outta know better . you don't know her well enough . she's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her , it's fuckin' over . you can deny it all you want , but it will not make one fucking bit of difference . you're dead .
i told you , you know , i thought i was doing the right thing , you know , i think she's innocent .
well , it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not . don't you understand , that's why you're a professional .
but , i mean , didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody ? i mean , you shoulda heard her there . tellin' her whole story . i believed her .
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer . here , here's a number of an immigration lawyer . that's how you help her . but you can't get involved in her like that . you're gonna jeopardize your career , your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case . and lemme give you another piece of advice . maybe you don't watch tv but i'll let you in on a little secret the whole fuckin' world watches television . and when you get out there , they know your face . and the little fame , the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job . and i get more done because of it .
why'd you help me back there with the chief ? why'd you stand up for me like that ?
you know , i don't know . i like you . you remind me of a puppy i used to have . he pissed on the rug all the time , but i still kept him .
who's there ?
police . we'd like to ask you a few questions .
i have nothin' to say . if you wanna contact my attorney .
homicide , miss hearn . it's detective eddie flemming . open up .
what's wrong ?
we don't have her i . d . yet , but one of your girls was killed last night at the king edward hotel .
yeah . he wanted a girl from czechoslovakia , but i sent him honey 'cause once they get there , you know , it doesn't really matter honey was killed . ? poor girl .
do you have any czech girls working for you ?
no .
did you tell him you did ?
boy , she's so popular all the sudden .
what are you saying ?
he said he was her cousin . i told him where she works . they were just here .
describe him .
tall , short haired , scary eyes . second guy with him was . shorter , with a wrestler's build . and he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me .
he had a videocamera ? where is she ? quickly !
she washes hair up at ludwig's a salon on rd and madison .
coffee for me , i gotta slow down .
vodka tonic .
it was freaky , i'll tell you . stupid kid .
i'm gonna propose .
when ?
tomorrow . at lunch .
what's he looking for ?
where is she ?
takin' a bath .
any i . d . ?
sorry . pd only .
only one guys checked in ?
yeah .
the other side of the street . the guy with the videocamera . don't look put her in the car . stay this side .
stay with her .
are you hit ?
he got my gun ! motherfucker was filming the whole time !
i know . relax . take it easy . don't worry , we'll get those fuckers .
don't you guys understand ? it's all about image . the better we look the more money i get to pay you guys overtime .
yeah , right .
what was that , korfin ?
i said , yeah , you're right , chief . as soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media .
did the d . a . videotape her deposition ?
yeah . he finished awhile ago .
alright . swing by her apartment . let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to hoover street . you got that ?
yeah .
who did cause and origin ?
who do you think , chief ? !
then why didn't you talk to the reporter ?
hey , chief , what are you doing here ?
i came to see how the investigation was going . i called and you're not here . i wait up at the station and you don't even show up ! i beep you you don't return my call . where the hell have you been ? !
ladder was on the rock for training . we stopped there . so she could get cleaned up .
what do you mean , 'cleaned up ? '
i let her take a shower .
a shower ! ? did you take one , too ?
no ! nothing happened .
oh really . that's nice . you took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot ? are you out of your fucking mind ? are you having that much trouble gettin' dates ? !
chief mind if i take her ?
the public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image ! this is going to be our rodney king !
what was i supposed to do ? the guy tried to mug me . i was gonna send a cop back i just forgot .
forgot ? you handcuffed a civilian to a tree ? !
chief i know i screwed up but this guy was no innocent civilian .
well this is gonna end your career and probably mine .
end my career ?
how are you going to fight this ? maybe if oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page , as a hero , this thing would be easier to fight . you'd have the good to weight against the bad ! it's unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing i can do ! gimme your shield .
but chief ? over this ?
oh .
it was my decision , not his .
well , i'm the deputy chief fire marshall and every now and then i'd like to be included in decisions .
look , after jordy briefs me , you can do the press conference . how about that ? the case is all yours .
oh yeah . ? alright .
i'm ready to be briefed . excuse us .
yeah , sure . beep me when you're ready for the press conference .
i told your partner , i can't help . i didn't see anything .
c'mon , start at the beginning . you know these people ?
tamina was a friend of mine . my shower was broken , she let me use theirs .
whether you tell us or not , we'll find out . better if it comes from you .
if i tell you , will you arrest me ?
are you here illegally ? don't worry about that . we'll talk to immigration . they won't deport you .
no , no , don't talk to immigration !
a cop ?
i'm from a small town in slovakia . like the south here . the police is right , a civilian is wrong . so i fled .
look , we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here . tell us the truth . is that the truth ?
. my little sister and i shared a flat i came home one night and a man was raping her . his gun was on the chair . he came at me and i shot him .
alright . that's a justifiable homicide .
now i become custody of police department ?
if you cooperate with the da maybe they'll help you with your situation .
i will if they don't send me back .
they won't until this is over .
are you married ?
divorced .
do you live alone ? i've been in these clothes since . the killings . could we stop at your place ? i could take a shower . before i go into custody ?
i can't take you to my place .
somewhere else ?
the men are out of quarters practicing putting out fires .
so . the station is empty ?
you considered becoming a prostitute ?
yes , i considered it .
did you ever turn tricks before ?
no .
what about back home ?
i came here . i had no money . i knew no one . i couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work . they approached me i could've made a lot of money . i considered it , but . it's not who i am . they pay me below the table at ludwig's .
so you were never a prostitute ?
what are you asking me ?
i'm just trying to find out who you are .
i'm not a whore . i'm not a whore .
i know .
you don't know . i'm sorry . i was desperate . that's not me . i shot a cop . can you imagine what they'll do to me when i got to prison ?
they're not gonna send you right back .
are you alright ?
i still can't believe eddie's gone .
i'm sorry .
is he your boyfriend ?
ludwig ? he's gay are you jealous ?
if i was your boyfriend , i might be .
if you were my boyfriend , i'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten thousand miles away .
a good immigration lawyer could stall the process . eddie recommended one .
no matter what happens . i'm glad i met you .
you better get packed .
right .
do you have coffee ?
in the kitchen .
i'll make some for us .
i'll get my clothes .
what are you doing ?
forget about me . you have enough problems of your own .
. do you really want me to forget about you ?
i don't want to drag you down with me .
daphne , i .
are you my attorney ? i'm emil . i'm insane .
i'm not your lawyer until i see the money .
oh no ! no ! shit !
emil . take it easy . stay with me . sit down . what do you need ? what are you looking for ?
he has the camera ! he took the movie !
don't say anything .
where are we going ?
i'm coming with you .
yes . yes , come with me !
i brought you some letters . it's really fan mail . women mostly . one wants to buy you clothes , another sent a check . another wants a check .
you bring the cigarettes ?
. delusions and paranoia .
i was all of these .
well , you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently . no question about that .
what about oleg ?
disappeared . they're looking everywhere . maybe he went back to czechoslovakia .
no , he is here . shit .
don't worry about him . think about yourself .
what about my movie rights ? book rights ?
look , i haven't really focused on that kind of thing .
what's your cut ? how much ?
i would say . half . half is fair .
no . no way .
but it's .
thirty percent . no more . or i call another lawyer . this is the biggest case of your life . don't try to negotiate . thirty percent . say yes or no .
this is not about money , emil . i need your trust in me .
what else do you need ?
i need to know about your background . i need to know about your upbringing . why you're here .
give me another one , please .
tell me about yourself . what you did as a young boy . what your parents were like .
my father always degraded me . killed my self esteem . and my mother was blind .
your mother was blind ?
yeah , she went blind giving birth to me . she went to fucking black market doctor to induce me .
back in the czech republic ?
yeah , yeah . bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind . and my father blamed me for her blindness .
your father blamed you for your mother's blindness ?
that's what he did to me . he put cigarettes out on me .
your father put cigarettes out on you ?
out on my back when i was a small boy .
can i see your back ?
i'm abused . don't you think ?
i don't think it's abuse , i think it's torture .
. so we kill someone famous and if we are caught , we are sent to mental hospital .
is that the man i knew , treasurer sanchez ?
yes , your majesty .
you were right , don sanchez . his demands could never be granted .
. into a monk .
yes . it would be a pity , wouldn't it ? call him back !
every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying . but with no gold ! the new world proves expensive , your majesty .
we weren't expecting immediate profits , were we ? we must have faith . we must give time for time .
. but there is worse . he ordered the execution of five members of the nobility .
then , what do you suggest , don sanchez ?
he must be replaced .
i know , i should not tolerate his impertinence .
then why ?
because he is not afraid of me .
where can i meet this man ?
you lied ! you cheated ! we're way past leagues !
six days ago , yes .
you must be mad . !
we have to keep the hopes of these men alive !
we're on the verge of a mutiny , colon !
you think i don't know that ?
we're lost !
the land is there . i know it !
you don't know anything ! listen colon , these are my ships , right ? so i'm telling you we're turning back !
and then what ? half of the water has gone , the rest is nearly putrid ! you know that !
jesus maria ! i should have never listened to you !
you never did . you did all the talking for both of us , remember ?
you bloody .
pinzon , pinzon . all we can do now is go forward ! think about that !
you tell that to them !
due west , captain mendez . and may god be with us .
well . it's the men , sir . they wonder how you know our position . we've lost sight from land days ago .
and what do you think mendez ?
well , i surely know what a quadrant is ! but i've never seen it used at night before .
what do you read ?
what's he doing ?
he's drawing an isthmus . he's saying we're on an isthmus .
we can't be .
and you say this is an indian vice ? by god ! i don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin .
the indians have no such word , don moxica .
we lost cousins , friends . we will wash this in blood .
you want a war ? fine . we are a thousand . they outnumber us by ten ! who will you kill ? which tribe ?
we don't need to know .
we can't raise the wheel without it .
my horse doesn't work .
don moxica we all have to work .
you did not hear me , don colon . not my horse .
in one act of brutality , you have created chaos . tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us ! all that because of your criminal savagery !
savagery is what monkeys understand .
you'll be held in detention , deprived of your privileges and possessions . until you are returned to spain where you will be judged . have you anything to say ?
you will regret this .
i should not even be listening to you , since my council said no . but santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity . and sanchez , that you are not a fool .
no more than the woman who said she would take granada from the moors .
the ocean is uncrossable ?
what did they say about granada before today ?
i cannot ignore the verdict of my council .
may i speak freely ?
you show no inclination to speak otherwise !
i know what i see . i see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is . who's not afraid . i see a women who thinks . what if ? .
how old are you , senor colon ?
thirty seven , your majesty . and you ?
do they have such thoughts ?
they come and go as naked as the day god created them .
but without your brothers . nor are you to return to santo domingo or any of the other colonies . you may explore the continent .
thank you .
there is one thing i'd like to understand . why do you want to go back , after all this ?
your majesty some men are content to read about things . i must see them with my own eyes . i cannot be other than i am .
diego is a bright boy a pleasure to teach but so serious . brothers should be raised together , colon . even brothers from different mothers .
god . that's in a week !
that's what it says .
how did you manage it ?
why do you wish to sail west ?
to open a new route to asia . at the moment there are only two ways of reaching it .
how can you be so certain ? the ocean is said to be infinite .
ignorance ! i believe the indies are no more than leagues west of the canary islands .
how can you be so certain ?
the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr , esdras .
esdras is a jew .
so was christ !
two minutes . and already you're a dead man . don't let passion overwhelm you , colon .
i'll try to remember that , marchena .
father marchena !
passion is something one cannot control !
you get so carried away when you are being contradicted !
i've been contradicted all my life . eternity !
you mustn't give way to despair . you must wait .
wait ! i've waited seven years already ! how much longer do you want me to wait ?
if god intends you to go , then you will go .
damn god !
colon !
all of them ! just lies !
in nomine patris et filius , et spiritus sancti .
forgive me , father . for i have sinned .
i am listening , my son .
father , i have betrayed my family . i betrayed my men . and i betrayed you .
what are you saying ?
i lied . the journey will be longer than i said .
how long ?
i am not sure . it could be twice the distance .
may god forgive you . ! you must tell them ! you must tell your men !
if i tell them , they won't follow me . you know that i am right , father . you trust me .
my son , my son . your certitudes are sometimes frightening . christopher , you must speak to them . and if you don't i will .
you are bound by an oath , father .
i believed in you .
give me absolution .
i suppose we're both old men now .
i have to disagree .
i knew you would .
new worlds create new people .
oh ? so you are a new man ?
i don't know . i have the impression that i didn't change that much . i still can't accept the world as it is !
say not here ! cuba !
what is it ? a tribe ? an island ?
you come ! you speak first !
tell the chief we thank him .
chief knows .
tell him his country is very beautiful . tell him we are leaving men here to build a fort .
chief says how many ?
thousands .
why ?
to bring the word of god .
chief says he has a god .
. and also to bring medicine .
chief says .
we will work with his people . we want peace . ask the chief if he understands ?
he understands .
you have to find them , utapan . look what they did !
you did the same to your god !
utapan , won't you speak to me ? you used to know how to speak to me .
you never learned how to speak my language .
no .
no ?
no . ! i have waited too long , fought too hard . now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit ! no . i will not be your servant !
i remind you , senor colon , that you are in no position to bargain with me .
i'm not bargaining !
then you are too ambitious .
and were you never ambitious , excellency ? or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles , a fault for the rest of us ?
if you won't accept our proposal , we'll simply find someone who will .
they don't see sin in their nakedness . they live according to nature , in a never ending summer . the islands are covered with trees , filled with blossoms and fruits . and .
you defend yourself admirably .
but we do have a lack of notaries . you should contact my administration .
don bobadilla is already a judge , my dear don cristobal .
good ! we are also in need of judges . except there are no thieves !
you seem to have a special talent for making friends .
what . ? do i have so many already ?
all i have to do is call the guards .
call them .
i am not afraid of you . you are nothing but a dreamer .
what do you see ?
roofs . towers , palaces . spires .
all of them created by people like me .
i want to go with you !
there'll be a time .
do you swear on all the holy saints in heaven ?
i have to explore the mainland .
this time with me !
how are you feeling , fernando ?
father .
what are you listening to ?
i am not listening , father . but i can't help hearing .
what does he say ?
he asks when he can come to visit you . he left his address .
he never had one . except aboard my ships !
i want you to tell me everything you remember , father . from the beginning . everything .
really ? god . i wouldn't know where to start . and yet .
tell me the first thing that comes to your mind .
i understand that you will soon be appointing governors for the islands ? is it not so ?
forgive me , don bobadilla those positions have already been taken .
may i ask by whom ?
bartolome and giacomo colon .
don alonso de bobadilla .
yes . i remember .
my letters of appointment .
appointment to what ?
viceroy of the west indies .
how far from here ?
i am not a seaman . but i heard it is no more than a week at sea . i hope you are not too disappointed .
how could i be ? the mainland has been found . exactly as i said it would .
i am afraid this is not the worst news .
i could be gone for years .
i know .
i haven't given you much of a life .
well . that's true . i have a child by a man who won't marry me ! who's always leaving .
are we going to argue ?
i'd love to argue with you sometimes . but you're never here !
perhaps i was never meant to live with a woman .
i find that hard to believe .
she said yes .
i'm not asking you to swear to anything .
i don't want you to wait for me .
that's something you can't decide .
beatrix , i want to ask you something .
you don't usually ask .
god . you're so beautiful ! i can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me .
they took everything .
can't you stay with us a little ?
what is it , now ? tell me .
i can't keep my eyes off you . i would like to catch up with all the moments i didn't spend with you .
the state has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition , your eminence .
the judgment is ours !
naturally . but i would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for spain for a . dispute over a point of geography .
he is a mercenary ! did he not already try to convince the king of portugal of his absurd notions ?
indeed . the world is full of mercenaries and states often make use of them , when it benefits them . my only concern is the welfare and prosperity of spain .
it won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now , don sanchez .
you can see for yourself .
what a tragedy . what a waste of a life .
a waste . ? let me tell you something , arojaz . if your name , or mine , is ever remembered it will only be because of his .
you say asia can be found by sailing west ?
yes , your eminence . the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks .
unfortunately , don colon , that is precisely where our opinions differ . are you familiar with the work of aristotle ? erathostene ? ptolemeus ?
i am , your eminence
senor colon , an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew . i am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment .
your eminence , there is only one way to settle the matter . and that is to make the journey . i am ready to risk my life to prove it possible .
your life , and that of others !
trade , your excellency . according to marco polo , the kingdom of china is one of the richest of the world . even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold .
is that all that interests you ? gold ?
no . the portuguese have already discovered black skinned people . i , too , will find other populations and bring them to the word of god .
if god intended our proximity to asia , do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world ?
did he not choose a carpenter's son to reveal himself to the world ?
don't you realize your words could be considered heretical ?
asia can be found to the west and i will prove it .
if god wills it !
i never seen heat like this ! not even in las minas !
the water's going putrid in the barrels .
what are you listening to , chicken ass ?
ah , leave him alone . he's doing no harm .
he's the devil's child .
we'll all go crazy .
we should have seen land .
we left three weeks ago , alonso . can't be that near .
in the microwave .
make anyone cry today ?
what's a synonym for throbbing ?
jesus ! can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating ?
tumescent !
you're not helping .
would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a british rear admiral ?
pirate no question .
they'll dance , they'll kiss , they'll come home . let her go .
what do you wanna watch ? we've got crap , crap , crap or crap
have a great time , honey !
what just happened ?
your daughters went to the prom .
did i have anything to say about it ?
absolutely not .
that ' s what i thought
i missed you .
it says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls .
it was a bratwurst . i was eating lunch .
i don't understand , patrick . you haven't done anything asinine this week . are you not feeling well ?
touch of the flu .
why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid ?
what's to discuss ?
you weren't abused , you aren't stupid , and as far as i can tell , you're only slightly psychotic so why is it that you're such a fuck up ?
well , you know there's the prestige of the job title . and the benefits package is pretty good .
you're completely demented .
say it
what ?
what plan ?
the situation is , my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford .
what is it with this chick ? she have three tits ?
i think i speak correctly when i say that cameron's love is pure . purer than say joey dorsey's .
dorsey can plow whoever he wants . i'm just in this for the cash .
that's where we can help you . with kat .
so dorsey can get the girl ?
patrick , pat , you're not looking at the big picture . joey's just a pawn . we set this whole thing up so cameron can get the girl .
you two are gonna help me tame the wild beast ?
we're your guys .
what ? !
good enough .
are you telling me i'm a non smoker ?
ever been to club skunk ?
yeah .
i prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows .
i'm likin' you guys better
so you got cozy with she who stings ?
you were right . she's still pissed .
sweet love , renew thy force !
man don't say shit like that to me . people can hear you .
hey there . tired of breathing ?
hi .
cool pictures . you a fan ?
you think ?
macbeth , right ?
right .
kat a fan , too ?
yeah .
katarina stratford . my , my . you've been terrorizing ms . blaise again .
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action .
well , yes , compared to your other choices of expression this year , today's events are quite mild . by the way , bobby rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well , in case you're interested .
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls . i was merely a spectator .
the point is kat people perceive you as somewhat .
tempestuous ?
no . i believe heinous bitch is the term used most often .
am i supposed to feel better ? like , right now ? or do i have some time to think about it ?
just smack her now .
i know .
i thought we decided you were going to school here . at u of .
this from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips ?
my insurance does not cover pms
then tell them i had a seizure .
is this about sarah lawrence ? you punishing me ?
i thought you were punishing me .
why can't we agree on this ?
because you're making decisions for me .
as a parent , that's my right
so what i want doesn't matter ?
you're eighteen . you don't know what you want . you won't know until you're forty five and you don't have it .
i want to go to an east coast school ! i want you to trust me to make my own choices . i want
was that your sister ?
yeah . she left with some bikers big ones . full of sperm .
i don't understand the allure of dehydrated food . is this something i should be hip to ?
no , daddy .
so tell me about this dance . was it fun ?
parts of it .
which parts ?
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy .
bianca did what ?
what's the matter ? upset that i rubbed off on her ?
you know , fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives . it means we've become spectators . bianca still lets me play a few innings . you've had me on the bleachers for years . when you go to sarah lawrence , i won't even be able to watch the game .
when i go ?
oh , christ . don't tell me you've changed your mind . i already sent 'em a check .
i mean wo man . how ya doin' ?
sweating like a pig , actually . and yourself ?
there's a way to get a guy's attention .
my mission in life .
pick you up friday , then
oh , right . friday .
the night i take you to places you've never been before . and back .
like where ? the eleven on burnside ? do you even know my name , screwboy ?
you hate me don't you ?
i don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion .
then say you'll spend dollar night at the track with me .
and why would i do that ?
come on the ponies , the flat beer , you with money in your eyes , me with my hand on your ass .
you covered in my vomit .
seven thirty ?
are you following me ?
i was in the laundromat . i saw your car . thought i'd say hi .
hi
you're not a big talker , are you ?
depends on the topic . my fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy .
excuse me ?
that's what you want , isn't it ?
you know , these guys are no bikini kill or the raincoats , but they're right up there .
you know who the raincoats are ?
what's this ?
i'm getting trashed , man . isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party ?
i say , do what you wanna do .
funny , you're the only one
okay ?
i'm fine . i'm
you're not okay .
i just need to lie down for awhile
uh , uh . you lie down and you'll go to sleep
i know , just let me sleep
what if you have a concussion ? my dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable . not that i could tell the difference .
this is so patronizing .
leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced .
why 're you doing this ?
i told you
you don't care if i die
sure , i do
why ?
because then i'd have to start taking out girls who like me .
like you could find one
see that ? who needs affection when i've got blind hatred ?
just let me sit down .
why'd you let him get to you ?
who ?
dorsey .
i hate him .
i know . it'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila . you don't seem like the type .
hey man . . . you don ' t think i can be cool ? you don't think i can be laid back like everyone else ?
i thought you were above all that
you know what they say
kat ! wake up !
what ?
and i'm in control of it .
when you were gone last year where were you ?
busy
were you in jail ?
maybe .
no , you weren't
then why'd you ask ?
i should do this .
do what ?
this .
start a band ?
my father wouldn't approve of that that
you don't strike me as the type that would ask permission .
oh , so now you think you know me ?
so what ' s up with your dad ? he a pain in the ass ?
he just wants me to be someone i'm not .
who ?
bianca
excuse me , have you seen the feminine mystique ? i lost my copy .
what are you doing here ?
i heard there was a poetry reading .
you 're so
wholesome .
unwelcome .
unwelcome ? i guess someone still has her panties in a twist .
don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties .
so what did i have an effect on ?
he left ! i sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me .
i guess i never told you i'm afraid of heights .
c'mon . it's not that bad
try lookin' at it from this angle
put your right foot there
forget it . i'm stayin' .
you want me to climb up and show you how to get down ?
maybe .
the partridge family ?
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect . and piss you off .
good call .
so how'd you get chapin to look the other way ?
i dazzled him with my wit
a soft side ? who knew ?
yeah , well , don't let it get out
so what's your excuse ?
acting the way we do .
yes
i don't like to do what people expect . then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change .
so if you disappoint them from the start , you're covered ?
something like that
then you screwed up
how ?
you up for it ?
state trooper ?
fallacy .
the duck ?
hearsay .
tell me something true .
i hate peas .
no something real . something no one else knows .
you're sweet . and sexy . and completely hot for me .
what ?
no one else knows
you're amazingly self assured . has anyone ever told you that ?
go to the prom with me
is that a request or a command ?
you know what i mean
no .
no what ?
no , i won't go with you
why not ?
create a little drama ? start a new rumor ? what ?
so i have to have a motive to be with you ?
you tell me .
you need therapy . has anyone ever told you that ?
answer the question , patrick
nothing ! there's nothing in it for me . just the pleasure of your company .
how'd you get a tux at the last minute ?
it's scurvy's . his date got convicted . where'd you get the dress ?
it's just something i had . you know
oh huh
look , i'm sorry that i questioned your motives . i was wrong .
my grandmother's .
what ?
that's where i was last year . she'd never lived alone my grandfather died i stayed with her . i wasn't in jail , i don't know marilyn manson , and i've never slept with a spice girl . i spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching wheel of fortune . end of story .
that ' s completely adorable !
wait i .
you were paid to take me out ! by the one person i truly hate . i knew it was a set up !
it wasn't like that .
really ? what was it like ? a down payment now , then a bonus for sleeping with me ?
i didn't care about the money .
a fender strat . you bought this ?
besides , i had some extra cash . some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl .
is that right ?
yeah , but then i fucked up . i fell for her .
why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill ?
because i like to torture you .
oh , bianca ? can you get me my freshman yearbook ?
don ' t you even dare . . .
who's that ?
patrick verona random skid .
that's pat verona ? the one who was gone for a year ? i heard he was doing porn movies .
i'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting .
he always look so
mandella , eat . starving yourself is a very slow way to die .
just a little .
what's this ?
an attempted slit .
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking , but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions . you're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy .
but imagine the things he'd say during sex .
the people at this school are so incredibly foul .
you could always go with me . i'm sure william has some friends .
so he has this huge raging fit about sarah lawrence and insists that i go to his male dominated , puking frat boy , number one golf team school . i have no say at all .
william would never have gone to a state school .
william didn't even go to high school
that's never been proven
i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death , but i'm consuming . do you mind ?
does it matter ?
if i was bianca , it would be , any school you want , precious . don't forget your tiara .
you think this'll work ?
no fear .
what'd he say ?
who cares ?
you went to the party ? i thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity .
i didn't have a choice .
you didn't have a choice ? where's kat and what have you done with her ?
i did bianca a favor and it backfired .
you didn't
can you even imagine ? who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess ?
well , i guess we're not , since we don't have dates .
listen to you ! you sound like betty , all pissed off because archie is taking veronica .
okay , okay , we won't go . it's not like i have a dress anyway
you ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective . we're making a statement .
have you seen him ?
who ?
william he asked me to meet him here .
oh , honey tell me we haven't' progressed to full on hallucinations .
hey .
are you lost ?
nope just came by to chat
we don't chat .
well , actually , i thought i'd run an idea by you . you know , just to see if you're interested .
we're not .
but she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her . right ?
does this conversation have a purpose ?
so what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her . someone who's up for the job .
i hear you're helpin' verona .
uh , yeah . we're old friend
you and verona ?
what ? we took bathes together when we were kids .
you better not fuck this up . i'm heavily invested .
hey it's all for the higher good right ?
yeah
what do you think ?
two legs , nice rack .
yeah , whatever . i want you to go out with her .
sure , sparky . i'll get right on it .
you just said
you need money to take a girl out
you got it , verona . i pick up the tab , you do the honors .
you're gonna pay me to take out some girl ?
i can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend . and that's the catch . she doesn't want a boyfriend .
i can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks .
take it or leave it . this isn't a negotiation .
fifty , and you've got your man .
when i shell out fifty , i expect results .
i'm on it
watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date .
i just upped my price
what ?
a hundred bucks a date .
forget it .
it's about time .
how'd you do it ?
do what ?
get her to act like a human
i don't know , dorsey . . the limo . the flowers . another hundred for the tux
the vintage look is over , kat . haven't you been reading your sassy ?
yeah , and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow . tough break .
they're running the rest of me next month .
hey do you mind ?
where ya goin ?
away .
your sister here ?
leave my sister alone .
and why would i do that ?
and he means that strictly in a non prison movie type of way .
what've you got for me ?
okay likes thai food , feminist prose , and angry , stinky girl music of the indie rock persuasion .
so what does that give me ? i'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments ?
gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night .
cameron , i'm a little busy
it's off . the whole thing .
what 're you talking about ?
she's partial to joey , not me
cameron do you like the girl ?
sure
then , go get her
what'd you do to her ?
i don ' t know . i decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it .
she hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . that's a direct quote
you makin' any headway ?
she kissed me .
what's the worst ?
you get the girl .
you the new guy ?
so they tell me .
so which dakota you from ?
north , actually . how'd you ?
i was kidding . people actually live there ?
yeah . a couple . we're outnumbered by the cows , though .
how many people were in your old school ?
thirty two .
get out !
how many people go here ?
couple thousand . most of them evil
that i'm used to .
yeah , but these guys have never seen a horse . they just jack off to clint eastwood .
that girl i
you burn , you pine , you perish ?
who is she ?
bianca stratford . sophomore . don't even think about it
why not ?
i could start with your haircut , but it doesn't matter . she's not allowed to date until her older sister does . and that's an impossibility .
why do girls like that always like guys like that ?
because they're bred to . their mothers liked guys like that , and their grandmothers before them . their gene pool is rarely diluted .
he always have that shit eating grin ?
you know french ?
sure do . my mom's from canada
guess who just signed up for a tutor ?
you mean i'd get a chance to talk to her ?
yeah , just a minor encounter with the shrew .
that's her ? bianca's sister ?
the mewling , rampalian wretch herself .
i teach her french , get to know her , dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me .
unlikely , but even so , she still can't go out with you . so what's the point ?
what about him ?
what makes you think he'll do it ?
he seems like he thrives on danger
no kidding . he's a criminal . i heard he lit a state trooper on fire . he just got out of alcatraz .
they always let felons sit in on honors biology ?
i'm serious , man , he's whacked . he sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers .
forget his reputation . do you think we've got a plan or not ?
did she actually say she'd go out with you ?
that's what i just said
you know , if you do go out with bianca , you'd be set . you'd outrank everyone . strictly a list . with me by your side .
i thought you hated those people .
hey i've gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street .
you got him involved ?
like we had a choice ? besides when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle , you're in a position of power . we let him pretend he's calling the shots , and while he's busy setting up the plan , you have time to woo bianca .
this is it . a golden opportunity . patrick can ask katarina to the party .
in that case , we'll need to make it a school wide blow out .
will bogey get bent ?
are you kidding ? he'll piss himself with joy . he's the ultimate kiss ass .
number one . she hates smokers
it's a lung cancer issue
her favorite uncle
he's pretty !
okay ! i wasn't sure
assail your ears for one night .
it's her favorite band .
you told me that part already .
hell , i've just been going over the whole thing in my head and
extremely unfortunate maneuver .
the hell is that ? what kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her ?
buttholus extremus . but hey , you're making progress .
you humiliated the woman ! sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score .
best case scenario , you're back on the payroll for awhile .
always a pleasure , brucie .
didn't have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan . aren't they a little too pre teen belly button ring for you ?
fan of a fan . you see a couple of minors come in ?
never
padua girls . one tall , decent body . the other one kinda short and undersexed ?
just sent 'em through .
now don't get upset . daddy , but there's this boy . and i think he might ask .
no ! you're not dating until your sister starts dating . end of discussion .
what if she never starts dating ?
then neither will you . and i'll get to sleep at night .
but she doesn't want to date .
exactly my point
daddy , i
and where're you going ?
if you must know , we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends .
otherwise known as an orgy ?
daddy , people expect me to be there !
oh , god . it's starting .
it's just a party . daddy .
wear the belly before you go .
daddy , no !
promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present .
why ?
because she'll scare them away .
daddy , i want to discuss the prom with you . it's tomorrow night
the prom ? kat has a date ?
no , but
it's that hot rod joey , right ? that ' s who you want me to bend my rules for ?
he's not a hot rod . whatever that is .
you're not going unless your sister goes . end of story .
fine . i see that i'm a prisoner in my own house . i'm not a daughter . i'm a possession !
i'm missing something .
i have a date , daddy . and he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know .
where've you been ?
nowhere . hi , daddy .
i have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way .
oh my god , does this mean you're becoming normal ?
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and we're going .
oh , i thought you might have a date i don't know why i'm bothering to ask , but are you going to bogey lowenstein's party saturday night ?
what do you think ?
you're ruining my life' because you won't be normal , i can't be normal .
what's normal ?
can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched ?
at least i'm not a clouted fen sucked hedge pig .
like i'm supposed to know what that even means .
it's shakespeare . maybe you've heard of him ?
you are so completely unbalanced .
bianca , i need to talk to you i need to tell you
i don't get you . you act like you're too good for any of this , and then you go totally apeshit when you get here .
listen , i know you hate having to sit home because i'm not susie high school .
like you care .
i do care . but i'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons , not someone else ' s .
i wish i had that luxury . i'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i can't go , because you won ' t .
joey never told you we went out , did he ?
what ?
in th . for a month
why ?
he was , like , a total babe
but you hate joey
now i do . back then , was a different story .
as in .
he said everyone was doing it . so i did it .
you did what ?
just once . afterwards , i told him i didn't want to anymore . i wasn't ready . he got pissed . then he broke up with me .
but
after that , i swore i'd never do anything just because everyone else was doing it . and i haven't since . except for bogey's party , and my stunning gastro intestinal display
why didn't you tell me ?
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him .
no . you didn't ! if you really thought i could make my own decisions , you would've let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage .
that's not
i'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes .
i guess i thought i was protecting you .
god , you're just like him ! just keep me locked away in the dark , so i can't experience anything for myself
not all experiences are good , bianca . you can't always trust the people you want to .
you looked beautiful last night , you know .
so did you
let go !
you set me up .
i just wanted
what ? to completely damage me ? to send me to therapy forever ? what ?
is that woman a complete fruit loop or is it just me ?
it's just you .
patrick is that a .
perm ?
it's more
expensive ?
exactly so , you going to bogey lowenbrau's thing on saturday ?
hopefully .
so yeah , i've got the sears catalog thing going and the tube sock gig that's gonna be huge . and then i'm up for an ad for queen harry next week .
queen harry ?
it's a gay cruise line , but i'll be , like , wearing a uniform and stuff .
neat .
hey , sweet cheeks .
hi , joey .
listen , i want to talk to you about the prom .
did you change your hair ?
no .
where did he go ? he was just here .
who ?
joey .
great
he practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist . i mean . dr . bonchowski is great an all , but he's not exactly relevant party conversation .
is he oily or dry ?
combination . i don't know i thought he'd be different . more of a gentleman .
bianca , i don't think the highlights of dating joey dorsey are going to include door opening and coat holding .
sometimes i wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with , you know ?
all i know is i'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like joey .
i have to be home in twenty minutes .
you think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom ?
can we make this quick ? roxanne korrine and andrew barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break up on the quad . again .
well , i thought we'd start with pronunciation , if that's okay with you .
not the hacking and gagging and spitting part . please .
okay . then how 'bout we try out some french cuisine . saturday ? night ?
you're asking me out . that's so cute . what's your name again ?
forget it .
no , no , it's my fault we didn't have a proper introduction
cameron .
the thing is , cameron i'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser . my sister . i can't date until she does .
why ?
unsolved mystery . she used to be really popular when she started high school , then it was just like she got sick of it or something .
that's a shame .
gosh , if only we could find kat a boyfriend .
let me see what i can do .
c'esc ma tete . this is my head
right . see ? you're ready for the quiz .
i don't want to know how to say that though . i want to know useful things . like where the good stores are . how much does champagne cost ? stuff like chat . i have never in my life had to point out my head to someone .
that's because it's such a nice one .
how is our little find the wench a date plan progressing ?
there .
where ?
you got something on your mind ?
i counted on you to help my cause . you and that thug are obviously failing . aren't we ever going on our date ?
you have my word . as a gentleman
you're sweet .
how do you get your hair to look like that ?
eber's deep conditioner every two days . and i never , ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment .
sure have .
i really , really , really wanna go , but i can't . not unless my sister goes .
she's not a .
lesbian ? no . i found a picture of jared leto in one of her drawers , so i'm pretty sure she's not harboring same sex tendencies .
so that's the kind of guy she likes ? pretty ones ?
hi .
looks like things worked out tonight , huh ?
you know chastity ?
have fun tonight ?
tons
i looked for you back at the party , but you always seemed to be occupied .
i was ?
you never wanted to go out with 'me , did you ?
well , no .
then that's all you had to say .
but
you always been this selfish ?
then guillermo says , if you go any lighter , you're gonna look like an extra on .
no .
do you listen to this crap ?
what crap ?
me . this endless . blonde babble . i'm like , boring myself .
i figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually .
what good stuff ?
the real you .
i'm kidding . you know how sometimes you just become this persona ? and you don't know how to quit ?
no
okay you're gonna need to learn how to lie .
wow
let's go .
she okay ?
i hope so .
they do to !
