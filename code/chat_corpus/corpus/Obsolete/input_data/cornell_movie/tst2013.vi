i don't know .
if there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about , tell me , but i have to ask . your husband . he committed suicide ?
yes .
september th , . about a year after mary disappeared .
we were divorced by then . things fell apart . he was living with a friend .
why do you think he did it ?
it got to be too much for him .
you have to forgive me , but in these circumstances . with your daughter . were there any indications of . any sort of abuse ?
there wasn't anything like that . the police and the fbi people asked , but there wasn't anything happened like that , never . my husband . his heart broke when mary left .
i didn't mean to .
you try going through what we did . bob couldn't take it , that's all . christ , there's times when it still seems like i can't either .
i had to ask . i apologize .
no one knows what it's like . you can't even imagine how much it hurts .
of course .
okay .
we're all like that .
are you religious ?
no .
you should be .
i've got what i need for my report . there is . there is one thing that bothers me though .
what ?
it's not really my place , but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either . see , i know a little about missing persons . when kids run , they almost always leave a note . it's guilt . they want to say goodbye .
there wasn't one . the police looked .
do you think the police did a good job ?
i don't know . i think so .
it is possible . and i know this isn't something you want to hear . your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it , but where she knew your husband would never find it . she might have wanted to tell you something .
no . you don't have any reason to think that .
if the police focused their search in her room , her belongings , well that'd be only natural , but they may have been looking in the wrong place .
how . how can you say that to me . ?
will you let me look ?
my husband never laid a hand on her . she would have told me . she would have told me .
you're probably right , and i probably won't find anything . i don't have a right to ask this , and you can kick me out of your house if you want , but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go . police are just as human as you or i . they could have missed something . they probably didn't . wouldn't you rather know ?
yes .
it's been six years .
what am i supposed to do ? forget her ? time heals all wounds , right ? she's all i think about , and i've learned to live with that . but , you want the truth . the real truth ? if i had a choice . if i had to choose , between her being out there , living a good life and being happy , and me not knowing never finding out what happened to her . . or her being dead and me knowing . i'd choose to know .
mrs . mathews ? it's thomas . do you remember , i was there a few weeks ago . asking about your daughter .
i remember . you just left .
i have to tell you something . it won't be easy for you to hear . it's about your daughter . mary anne . when i . when i was there with you , her diary , in your attic , in silverware . if you read it , you'll know what i'm telling you is true .
what are you talking about . ?
she went to california , to los angeles . she wanted to start over . she wanted to be an actress .
what . ?
mrs . mathews , your daughter is dead . she's dead .
who is this . ?
someone . some men , they took your daughter and they drugged her , and they took her to a motel room . they did terrible things to her .
who are you ?
they brought her into the room . one man , he put a knife to her throat and he raped her .
no .
he raped her and . and . and he murdered her . he cut her up with knifes .
no . no . no .
they killed her , and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her .
why . why are you doing this to me . ?
they murdered her , mrs . mathews , i'm sorry . it happened a month after she ran away . she's been dead all this time .
mister welles . you're very prompt .
i try to be .
apparently mr . longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak .
thank you .
he's a lawyer . please , sit , here .
i've been privileged to provide services for people i admire .
you are highly recommended . praised for your discretion . your strict adherence to confidentiality .
my condolences .
his passing has left me with . something of a dilemma . a terrible , terrible dilemma .
i'll do whatever i can to help .
mostly . that's where he started his empire building . he was a good man . notorious as an eccentric , but that was something he cultivated . he wanted to be legendary .
he succeeded .
we were married forty five years . hard even for me to imagine . we had our troubles . there were plenty of places for him to be other than here , but he was always loyal to me , and i to him . i loved him deeply .
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to . other than that , there's never any reason .
just curious .
you hired someone to open it . i'll bet the lawyer loved that .
there was nothing he could do . my husband left everything to me . i prevented anyone from seeing the contents . i felt these were my husband's private things . i didn't . i didn't realize .
do you want to tell me what you found ?
cash , stock certificates , and this .
i'm afraid i don't .
this is a movie showing a girl being murdered . she's sitting on a bed , and a man rapes her . and he begins to cut her with a knife . i only watched what i could .
mrs . christian . please , will you sit down a moment ? i want you to listen carefully . what you're talking about is a snuff film . but , from what i know , snuff films are a kind of . urban myth . like , red light district folklore . there's no such thing , i can assure you .
no .
if you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away . you'd see the tricks they can play .
i'm telling you it's not that .
i'm sure it is . it's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke . more than likely he never even watched it .
will you watch it and see for yourself ?
of course . but , i'm certain it's nothing to worry about .
i told you i can't , not yet .
you don't have any other choice .
no . for me to live with the ruin of my husband's name , i need know that whoever did this will be punished . if you can find them , i will take their names to the police . i'll say my husband confessed on his death bed . i'll say i didn't have courage to come forward at first .
it won't work like that .
any evidence you collect can be given to the police later , anonymously . i've thought about it and there's no other way . if you can't find them . if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for , well i can't let that happen . i'm telling you i won't . if there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served , then i'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her .
i deal in divorce cases . corporate investigations .
you've found missing persons before .
nothing remotely like this .
i know what i'm asking . your compensation will be appropriate to the risk . you'll need cash to buy information , and i'll provide it . i feel responsible , mr . welles . you saw what he did to her .
okay .
my husband never dealt with money personally , certainly not cash .
i'm not positive this means anything .
the checks were for odd amounts .
okay , i follow you so far .
totalled together , these five checks from five different accounts , they equal one million dollars .
you're joking .
to the penny . exactly one million dollars in cash .
i'm here .
do you think the film could have cost that much ?
for a human life . murder on film , no statute of limitations . who knows ? it sure could have . i'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks , then put them in a safe deposit box .
okay .
send it to me through the post office like we arranged . no return address . you dug this up all by yourself ?
you told me to look , so i looked .
you're one hell of a detective , mrs . christian .
hello ?
mrs . christian , tom welles here .
how are you ? having any luck ?
i don't know if luck's the word . are you feeling alright ?
i've been ordered into bed . the doctor says i've gotten the flu , or some other wretched ailment .
i hope it's nothing serious .
nothing more than a bother . have you any news for me ?
i've made progress . i'm in manhattan . once a few more pieces fall into place , i'll drive to you and give you an update .
fine .
i've got about five thousand left in cash , but i'll need another thirty , if you approve .
how will i get it to you ?
if you have a pencil and paper , i'll tell you how to send it .
big date tonight ?
yeah . guess so .
can i interest you in a battery operated vagina ?
pardon me ?
my boss tells me i have to do more suggestive selling .
well , it's tempting , but no thanks .
it's your call , but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery operated vagina and you don't have one .
i'll risk it .
once you pick it up you can't put it down .
catchy title . what are you really reading ? hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting .
i tear off the cover and paste this one on . you know how it is .
wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts .
might get drummed out of the pornographer's union , and then where would i be ?
remember me ?
came back for that battery operated vagina , right ? told you you would .
i need some information . thought you might be able to help .
thomas welles . nice picture .
good for you .
three , four years .
what's your name , if you don't mind me asking ?
max .
well , here's the deal , max . this thing i'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography . stuff that's sold under the counter , illegally .
there's not much illegal .
well , whatever there is , whoever's dealing , however it's done , i want to know . i want a good look , so if you've got that kind of connection , great . if not , speak now .
you're not a cop , are you ? if i ask and you are , you have to tell me .
i'm not a cop .
you're a private eye . like shaft .
not quite .
from pennsylvania . p . i . from pa . what are you doing out here ?
well , there's the thing you're not gonna know anything about what i'm doing , but you can make some money .
how much ?
how much do you make now ?
four hundred a week , off the books .
okay , let's pretend i live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump . i'll give you six hundred for a few days .
sounds good , pops .
here's my number if you need it . when can you start ?
tomorrow night , i get off at eight .
see you then . oh , and , don't call me pops .
wake up , pops . your education begins tonight .
interesting theory .
what you saw tonight , we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend . we're talking about stuff where people get hurt . specialty product .
child pornography .
there's two kinds of specialty product legal and illegal . foot fetish , shit films , watersports , bondage , spanking , fisting , she males , hemaphrodites . it's beyond hardcore , but legal . this is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up , another guy looks at it and falls in love . now , with some of the s m and bondage films , they straddle the line . how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not ? step over that line , you're into kiddie porn . rape films , but there aren't many . i've never seen one .
snuff films .
i heard you asking . that guy wasn't yanking you around . there's no such thing .
what other ways are there to get illegal films ? who do you see ?
first of all , basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer . it's too risky , one , and two , everything's going on the internet . anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants . it's heaven for those degenerate chicken hawks . they're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em . but , there's still some weird shit under the counter where i work sometimes . no one knows where it comes from . that's local underground , where information spreads by word of mouth . those are zombies , hardcore junkies . their hands are permanently pruned . they go out in the sun they don't burn , they blister . other than that , all i know about is the mail . classified ads in the paper with hidden codes . secret couriers . credit card orders to dummy corporations . interstate wire transfers . revolving p . o . boxes . but , if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit . who knows ? that's the whole point the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible , and vice versa , and cops can't trace the deal . there's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is .
how old are you ?
twenty five .
where are your parents ?
i don't know , where are yours ?
i don't mean any offense . but what are you doing mixed up in all this ?
i'm not mixed up in anything , hayseed . what are you talking about ?
you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else .
yeah , i'm a real genius . what choices have i got ? fuck , just because i know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean i deal it . i work a job . it beats pumping gas , beats making hamburgers .
you're telling me it doesn't get to you ?
you can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb . so what ? am i gonna go off and be a race car driver ? go to harvard ? run for president ? what about you , pops ?
what about me ?
i see a ring on your finger . you have any kids ?
a daughter .
so , you have a wife and kid waiting for you in pennsylvania . what are you doing mixed up in all this ?
good question .
dino velvet . yeah , he's like the john luc godard of s m flicks , supposed to be a real weirdo .
a weirdo making s m films ? who'd have thought it ?
his stuff comes out of new york . bondage and fetish videos , gothic hardcore . definitely not for the squeamish .
specialty product .
you're learning .
where does he sell it ?
out of the back of bondage magazines mostly , but you can find it on the street if you look . he'll also do commissions , for enough money .
alright , i get the picture .
he cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs , newsreel footage , subliminal images . thinks he's making art .
well , i'm in new york now . what do you say to flying out and giving me a hand ?
i'm a working stiff , pops .
take a vacation . i'll pay you four hundred a day , plus expenses .
you want me to come out there and play private eye ?
consider it . meanwhile , dig up whatever dino velvet films you can . get receipts . i'll call back .
see ya .
it's their presidential suite .
great .
it's cheap , and people know to mind their own business . what have you got for me ?
wha . ?
who is this , in the mask ? who is he ?
i told you , he's one of dino velvet's stock players .
who is he , his name ?
nobody knows his name . that's his thing . he always wears a mask . you never see his face . he calls himself machine , that's what they call him . machine .
you don't need to be here .
what kind of junior p . i . would i be if i didn't go with you ?
devil frightened me as much as it excited me , but i'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite .
what's next ?
i'm trying to figure that out myself . i have to see machine without his mask .
still don't want to tell me what you're doing ?
nope .
what's this ?
it's money . people use it to purchase goods and services .
look . that's awful generous and everything .
it's not my money . the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought . let's not make a big deal out of this , okay ? go be a race car driver . go run for president . whatever .
yes , i do have something to say . i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs . christian contacted you .
i'm listening .
as mr . christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate , it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend .
of what sort ?
you are a private investigator ?
that's right .
well , whatever reasons mrs . christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator , i should certainly be a party to . but , since she feels differently , i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval .
you were the middleman , am i right ? old man christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself .
wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature .
so , he sent you , gave you the money , his errand boy . and if you refused , it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film . that's the beauty of lawyer client privilege .
that's trust . mr . christian trusted me implicitly .
must have paid you a lot , for you to risk everything . would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money .
i was well compensated .
that's why you got scared when mrs . christian hired me . you knew about the film , figured it had to be in that safe . how'd you find me ?
never mind how i found you .
followed me . must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies .
they're no friends of mine .
except , you're willing commit murder with them .
none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone . if you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago . a girl no one even remembers .
mary anne mathews , that was her name . her mom remembers her .
shut up .
mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered .
shut your mouth and drive !
did it get him off , huh , watching them cut her up ? tell me , because i really want to understand . did he jerk off to it ? you watch it with him , sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched . ?
you're making me very angry .
just tell me . tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared . what kind of degenerate pervert was he really ? what the fuck did he want with a snuff film ?
you're asking me why ?
i'm asking .
a man like mr . christian , a great man . all his money , all his power . a man who attained everything there was to attain .
why did he buy a film of some poor , lost girl getting butchered ?
isn't it incredibly obvious ?
enlighten me .
because he could . he did it because he could . what other reason were you looking for ?
fuck you .
give me the film .
you'll get it when we get there .
give me the film .
go ahead , shoot me . then try driving to brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield .
he's lying .
look at him . you think he played it square ? how much did he give you , how much did he keep for himself ?
you know how my tapes sell . people eat this stuff up .
i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month . do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt , and try to fucking return it ?
maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place , ever think of that ?
the only thing wrong is the cheap , softcore crap you're peddling , eddie . where do you get this stuff ?
look , you cocksucker .
get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head . till then , fuck you .
fuck you !
eddie .
yeah , who's this ?
i know what you did .
what ?
i know what you did .
who is this .
you murdered that girl , eddie . six years ago .
what the fuck are you . ?
you killed that girl and you put it on film . you and your pals , you're fucked . you fucked up real good .
what's he talking about ?
one million dollars , dino . how much did he tell you he had .
i'm gonna kill you .
don't bore me with that bullshit .
how'd you find me here ?
don't ask questions .
fuck you !
starting to recognize a pattern ?
what do you want ?
who is machine ?
i don't know .
i want his name .
i told you , i don't know .
i will never get tired of hurting you , eddie , so you might want to change your attitude .
what the fuck am i gonna protect that freak for ? he was dino's boy , not mine . he shows up with his mask on , leaves with his mask on . nobody knows .
okay , we'll come back to that . so , six years ago a guy contacts you , through the classifieds , over the phone , however he does it . it's longdale , looking for a snuff film . and you , entrepreneur that you are , tell him you can hook him up .
yeah , the fucking lawyer .
told him you could get him a snuff film .
yeah .
how much did he pay you ?
thirty thousand each , that fucking cocksucker .
that's all ? thirty each . that's all it took for you to murder her ?
it was a lot of fucking money .
so . you brought dino in , and he brought machine . and , one day , a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models . and she never walked out .
something like that .
what did you do , knock her out , shoot her up . ?
what the fuck do you want from me ?
i want to know . i want to know exactly what you did to her !
fuck you then , you want to know ? i talked her up , told her how beautiful she was , told her she was gonna be a star . i told her i was gonna get her a screen test , and while i'm doing that , i got her a soda and dropped a mickey . when it was dark enough , i rang dino and told him it was go time , i put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it . that's what happened . she's dead . she's been dead a long fucking time . nobody fucking cares !
show me where you did it , on the map , exactly where you did it .
why ?
because we're going there .
i don't know . i felt like it . i never saw anyone get done before .
you enjoy it ?
made me sick , but what did i care ? what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that . it was just something i was doing for money .
tell me what happened .
what do you want to know ? you saw it , you saw the loop .
nobody saw you bring her in ?
there wasn't nobody around . this place was a shit hole . i backed up the car to the door and we carried her in , like groceries . dino made her eat a bunch of pills , we laid out the plastic , put film in the camera and machine went to work .
what did you do with her body ?
took it out the bathroom window . buried it in the woods .
show me .
where do you think you're taking this , huh ? gonna be a big hero , avenge that little girl's death ? gonna make everything right with the world ? how you gonna do that . ?
stop talking .
you got absolute zero .
show me where you buried her .
i don't know . . out there somewhere .
where ? show me where .
i fucking don't know . what do you think . we weren't burying treasure . we didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it . we dug a hole and we put her in it . your guess is as good as mine .
don't think i won't .
do it ! put me out of my misery so i don't have to listen to you whining anymore . you think it's so easy ?
easy enough for you .
i never killed anyone .
that's right , you just stood there and watched , because you felt like it . almost makes you worse .
what do you want ? you want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby . ?
what can i do for you , mr . welles ?
call me tom .
alright , tom .
what i'd like , very simply , is access to your archive . and , now i understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens .
there are reasons for the way we do things here .
absolutely . of course i'll abide by whatever decision you make , but i'd appreciate if you'll hear me out .
why not go to the n . c . i . c . or n . c . m . e . c . ?
i figured you share information .
we do .
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive .
why don't they come to me ?
this doctor and wife , they're nice people , but they don't want to get too involved . they're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either . you and i both know sometimes , not often , but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run . molestation , whatever . besides that , the girl's probably eighteen , so she's legal .
i'm not so sure about this .
they're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay , even if that's all they hear .
i can give you my card , if your clients want to call me .
they were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them .
well , that's all i can do . sorry .
any good ?
it's horrible , but it'll be your best friend after a few days . i hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after .
you're gonna be seeing a lot of me . you're sure you don't mind ?
it's good what you're doing .
is that him ?
put the gun down , take the handcuffs . handcuff yourself to the bed .
move it , dirtbag . !
leave him alone .
fuck off .
first things first . you might want to watch this , mr . welles .
you got the guts , tough guy ? gonna kill us all , is that it ?
you betrayed us .
it's an honor to meet you . thank you for seeing us .
what can i do for you today ?
i'd like to commission a work . i'm a great admirer of yours .
flattering . and , who's your colorful little chum ?
a fellow investor .
hmm .
yes . what we're looking for is rather specific .
is it ?
five thousand now , five thousand on delivery . two women , one white and one black , as long as they have large breasts . hard bondage , or course . other than that , trusting your artistic interpretation , i have only two stipulations .
and they are ?
i want to watch you work .
i'll consider it .
and the other performer . it has to be that monster you use . the man in the mask .
machine .
if it's not him , there's no deal .
he might be interested . but it would mean another five thousand .
we can do that .
well , well , i'll have to put my thinking cap on about all this . you'll leave the money as a deposit ? very good .
i'd rather you didn't .
what's the problem ?
i'm camera shy .
you trust me to keep your money , but not to take your picture ?
those are two different kinds of trust . thank you for your time . i hope we can do business .
i'll do this for you . fifteen thousand dollars .
machine's in ?
he's in . it will be his pleasure .
where's that ?
brooklyn . don't be late .
right here .
excellent .
where are the women ?
they should be here any minute .
what are these for ?
hmm ? oh , the knifes ? they're just props . nice , aren't they ?
sure .
mister welles . would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person ?
what are you . ?
take out your gun !
look , i don't know what this .
shut up , cunt ! do exactly as i say , or i'll put this arrow through your throat .
i remember him .
friend of yours ?
look , he's got nothing to do with this . let him go .
can you guess what i'm going to say next ?
he doesn't know anything . he's got nothing to do with this .
bring the film , or we kill him .
i'll get it . it's in a safe deposit box , in the city .
how cooperative . longdale will keep you company .
what do you want ?
i just got a call . two seconds ago , some motherfucker called . says he knows about the loop .
what are you talking about ?
the loop ! the girl we did , what the fuck do you think i'm talking about ? ! this guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop .
bullshit .
i'm telling you .
blow me , you paranoid fuck , that's impossible . why are you bothering me with this . ?
because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out !
there's nothing there , you brain dead cunt . think about it . there's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything . i want you to hang the phone up , and if you call me about this again i'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader .
dino .
nobody knows anything .
what the fuck . !
i promised him to machine .
what are these ?
mixed hard bondage . rape films . sick shit . buy five , get one free .
anything harder ?
there's nothing harder .
snuff ?
what you see is what i got , mister .
you know where i can get it ? i have a lot of money to spend .
there ain't no such thing as snuff . why don't you fuck off ?
welcome home .
do you know how much i missed you ?
what's this . have you been smoking . ?
smoking ? i'm not smoking .
your clothing reeks of it .
you know , amy , i've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy . i mean , is this what i get first thing ? before you even hello , you accuse me . ?
i'm not accusing you .
well , i'm not smoking , okay ?
okay , i believe you .
we've been all through that . i've been on my best behavior .
how's the detective business ?
business was fine . i'll tell you what , you couldn't pay me enough to live down there .
you better not be smoking , that's all i can say .
honey , i'm not , please .
i love you .
i love you .
you think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend ?
sure . i'll call the guy .
you're not using the same guy who tried to fix it ?
i'm not using him again for anything . he was worthless . you have bridge here saturday ?
betty's out of town so we're playing next week .
this is the mortgage . this is cindy's college money .
i understand .
sometimes you can't know what i'm doing . it's better that way .
i know .
it's a missing persons case . a long shot . i'll give it two months , two months at most , then i'll be back . we'll take a vacation .
why the gun ?
i'm not gonna need it . i won't even wear it . it's a precaution . don't worry about me .
hello ?

i wanted to call . i couldn't .

yes , sir !
dispatch me another zfx immediately . someone stole mine .
right away , sir . i'll send you a new one to the hotel .

staedert , do you read me ?
i can hear you , mr . president , but i can't see you .

perfect , mr . president .
i have to address the supreme council in minutes . just the facts , general .
there are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet , all the calibers are overshot . we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging .
what you are saying is you don't know what this . thing . is .
not yet sir . the only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger !
options .
wait or act .
recommendations .
my philosophy mr . president is shoot first ask questions later . i don't like uninvited guests .
gentlemen ?
i'm about to , mr . president .
i managed to contact the mondoshawan . they deplore the incident , but accept our apologies .
and the stones ? did you find them in the wreckage ?
the stones weren't aboard the ship .
. what do you mean ?
don't worry , sir . i have the perfect one .
how much time is left ?
this is all that survived ?
actually only one cell survived .
have you identified it ?
it's not that easy . we've never encountered anything like it before . you see normal human beings have dna memo groums . which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself . this one has , .
talk english doc .
this cell is like a huge library . it has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside . almost like it was . engineered .
sounds like a freak of nature to me .
yes . i can't wait to meet him .
is there any danger ? some kind of virus ?
we put it through the cellular hygiene detector . the cell is for lack of a better word . perfect .
wonderful !
an elephant couldn't crack it .

you're nothing but a . a .
the words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied . i won't be long .
i'm so very sad .

five hundred wars . arms . drugs . money . everything you create is used to destroy .
i told you not to read all that crap !
protect life . until death .
leeloo ? the stones ! we have to open them ! how does it work ?
the wind blows . the fire burns .
i know all that , leeloo ! i'm talking about the stones .

i want to sleep . forever .
leeloo ! listen to me ! i'll take you on a vacation afterwards ! a real vacation , this time , for as long as you want . come on ! you can do it !
what's the use of saving lives . when you see what you do with them !
you're right but there are lots of good things . beautiful things .
. like love .
exactly .
but i don't know love . i'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own .
yes , you do ! i need you . more than you can imagine ! stand up straight !

major dallas , if our calculations are correct you still have hours owed to the federal army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance .
what mission ?
to save the world .
where have i heard this song before ?
you're to leave immediately for fhloston paradise . retrieve four stones from the diva plavalaguna . and bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible . any questions' ?
just one . why me ?
three reasons . one as part of the elite special forces unit of the federated army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission .
and the third one ?
you're the only one left alive .
i've had enough good news for today
you have won the annual gemini contest and a trip to fhloston paradise . for two . congratulations . here are your tickets .
you couldn't come up with something a little more discreet ?
old tricks are the best tricks eh ?
i'm not going .
why not ?
one reason . i want to stay the only one left alive .
what is it ?
it's my wife .
i thought you were divorced .
i mean my future . my ex . my future ex . if she sees you here i'm finished . she hates you guys . it's what killed us in the first place . please .

you're the nastiest dirtbag i know in this stinking city !
hi ma .
i've been playing twice a week for years , years i've been eating those shitty croquettes .
yes ma .
. and now you're making fun of me ? i'm warning you ! if you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice , i'll never forgive you !
i'm coming ! . ma , what're you talking about ?
i get it ! you want to make me beg , is that it ?
all i want is an explanation ! i just got in , i lost my job . i smashed my cab . i got mugged , but other than that everything's peachy , ma , thanks for asking ! now settle down and explain to me calmly .
you just won a trip , you dolt ! ten days in fhloston paradise for two !
ma . if i'd won , i'd know about it . someone would have notified me .
they've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour , blockhead !
yeah ?
have you pulled yourself together ?
. not yet .
you little sleaze bag !
. ma ?
don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again , you've killed your poor mother with your own hands !
the fifth element .
take them and put them in a safe place .
will the elements be gone now forever from this place ?
when mankind comes to its senses . we will return .
knowing mankind as i do , that could take centuries !
time is of no importance , only life is important .
we will be ready , lord .
akina delutan , nou shan .
. 'scuse me ?
daya deo dono dato . dalutan !
it there's one thing i don't need advice on , it's how to drive .
. priest .
you're not that bad . come on we'll get you to a doctor .
vito . cor . ni lious . priest .
vito cornelius ?
eto akta gamat !
i'm sorry , it's just that . i was told to wake you up gently , so i figured .
leeloo minai lekarariba laminai tchai ekbat de sebat .
hey , that's . cute . do you have a nickname , something a little . shorter ?
. leeloo .
yeah ?
hey bud ! finger here .
i was talking to the cat .
oh , yeah , i forgot . you still prefer your cat to the real thing .
at least , the cat comes back .
you still pining for that two timing bitch . forget her . there are a million women out there .
i don't want a million i just want one . a perfect one .
don't exist bud .
i just found a picture of you .
how do i look ?
like shit .
you forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions . i know how you drive .
finger ! i'm driving a cab now , not a space fighter !
how many points you got left on your license ?
uh . at least fifty .
in your dreams ! see you tonight !
hello ?
hey bud . i'm waiting all day here .
finger . man . i'm sorry . listen . i was on the way over but i had a fare fall into my lap . y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist .
so , just how big was this fare ?
' , green eyes . long legs . great skin . perfect .
uh huh . and i don't suppose you got the name of this . perfect fare .
leeloo .
you're a good man . she was right to have chosen you .
who ?
the fifth element . the supreme being . your wife .
leeloo . is . she's .
yes , and more than that . you must give her the stones , she's the only one who knows how to use them .
. so cornelius was telling the truth !
she was taught to love the life of others . but not her own . you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live !
i'll help her , i promise , but i think you should tell me where the stones are !
do you love her ?
i . i don't know ! we hardly know each other . it takes time !
i don't have time . i need to know .
listen , the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her . i never saw her again .
i would like to have died in peace .
i'm sorry , but . the stones .
they are . with me .
it's a miracle !
what is ?
i can't wear these clothes ! this calls for dignity ! i have to dress the part !
father , will you please explain what's going on ?
the supreme being , the fifth element is here , in our parish ! it's a miracle !
father . you sure she's the supreme being ?
absolutely sure there's the triple suns on her gloves !
what's she doing ?
learning our history ! the last years that she missed ! she's been out of circulation a while , you know .
uh father , i know she's been through a lot . but the sacred stones . we don't have much time .
yes . of course .
i didn't know your size .
perfect .
i got it ! everything here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel . and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel !
good work , my son . now all we need is a way to get there .
on the plane . with mr . dallas . the real one .
it's all my fault . i'm the servant . it's my mission ! here !
you're all safe . thanks be to god !
later , david ! later ! there's not a minute to lose !
one more reason to shoot first eh ?
time is of no importance , mr . president . only life is important .
that's exactly what we are going to try and do protect the lives of some billion of our fellow citizens ! general ? you may fire when ready .
we have forty eight hours , the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions .
and then ?
and then it will be too late . the goal of evil is to wipe out life ! all forms of life . for all eternity . life upsets it .
is there anything that can stop it ?
yes . thank god .
but what happens if instead of this . ultimate warrior . it is evil who stands here ?
white turns to black . light to dark . life to death . for all eternity .
did you see that . thing . swallow our battleship like a gum drop ? you can't even tell me what it is ! i ask you for options you give me bullshit . give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards .
thank you , mr . president .
this is government business now . you ought to go home and get some rest , father .
excuse me , i'm looking for a priest .
weddings are one floor down . congratulations .
she's not my bride , she's my fare . she's looking for this vito cornelius . according to the phone guide he lives here .
that's me . but i don't know who she is . where did you find her ?
she dropped in on me . holding this .
who are you ?
i brought the girl remember ?
the girl ?
you noticed .
there's not a moment to lose ! wake her up , but be gentle about it ! this woman is mankind's most precious possession ! she is . perfect !
so you do know her .
uh yes , we're cousins . distant cousins .
they all like this in your family , father ?
she's an exception .
dallas . korben dallas .
yes . that's fine ! thank you very much . a thousand times over !
i might call to check up on her , you know . to see if she's better ?
she's fine , really . don't you worry . just needs some rest . she's had a very long trip .
i know . i was there when she arrived .
it means , never without my permission .
that's what i thought .
i'm sorry to have to resort to such methods , but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston .
is that the usual way priests go on vacation ?
we're not going on vacation . we're on a mission .
what kind of mission ?
we have to save the world .
good luck .
of course .
father , i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i lost a lot of friends . so thanks for the offer . but no thanks .
what are you doing ?
trying to save your ass so you can save the world .
you're probably very angry with me and i quite understand . but i want you to know i'm fighting for a noble cause .
yeah , i know . to save the world . but right now all i want to do is save leeloo .
leeloo's in trouble ?
when is she not in trouble ?
uh . have you tried the diva's suite ?
don't tell me you don't know how all this works ?
theoretically , yes ! the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there , but . i don't have the reference book . i've never seen the stones work !
there's no light ! you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light .
yes , of course , but . the stones are shut ! they have to be open for it to work .
and you don't know how they open , is that what you are saying ?
that's what i'm saying .
i'm fucked !
i remember you now . the so called art dealer .
i'm glad you got your memory back , father . because you're going to need it . where are the stones ?
. why on earth do the stones interest you ?
personally , they are of no interest to me , i'd rather sell weapons . but i have a customer . so tell me .
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you .
why ? what's wrong with me ?
. i'm a priest ! i'm here to serve life , all you want to do is destroy it .
ah , father . you are so wrong . let me explain .
no thank you .
follow me . life , which you so nobly serve , comes from destruction . look at this empty glass .
they are robots !
father , by creating a little destruction , i am , in fact , encouraging life ! so , in reality , you and i are in the same business !
destroying a glass is one thing . killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another .
let me reassure you father . i will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last years .
you are a monster , zorg !
i know .
appipulai leeloo minai .

this is clean shit . no serial numbers and never been used .
don't mess with me . how much ?
five bills .
five . on credit .
this ain't a credit business .
yeah , i know that , but this is me and we're old friends . i haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it ?
give it back .
try and take it .
fuck you . you got no right for this kind of play .
i'll got your money to you . no sweat .
surprise , luther .
whaddya want ? i thought you were locked up
i want the money , asshole , what do you think ? the money that reggie hid .
i don't know what you're talkin' about .
you want that indian to snap her neck ?
don't give me this , we were partners .
billy , go ahead , break it .
no ! don't kill her . i can get you the money .
when ?
i can't get it until monday . honest .
you chickenshit punk .
honest . the place we stashed it opens monday morning . i can't get it till then . monday morning , that's when it opens . after that , i'll get the money to you right away .
you try to mess with us or go to the cops , i promise you , i'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe .
let her go .
first , the money .
rosalie , you okay ?
what are you talkin' about ? i said i wouldn't hurt her .
hot ? hey , they're not even room temperature .
how ya doin' ?
can't complain .
we got a lot to talk about .
yeah , old times .
we'll follow you . take it slow , okay ?
sure , right .
hey .
shut up .
what the hell's wrong ? i didn't do anything .
shut up .
what do you want ?
keep stallin' .
alright , i'm coming . hold on .
who the hell are you ?
name's hammond , reggie hammond . i heard a lot about you . and any friend of jack's is a friend of mine .
i'm not so sure i can say the same thing . you don't look like a cop .
well , i been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years . and you don't exactly look like a shrink , wearin' that dress .
shrink major , not a shrink .
hard man to live with .
how would you know ?
hey , two days with him is enough .
that's no bull .
he was the only one of my bunch that was my friend . he was loyal , went all the way for you .
in all due respect , he sounds kind of pathetic to me . the kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend . have you two ace detectives checked that out ?
i don't answer questions , i ask 'em .
i don't think your gun's loaded .
this is a . magnum , the most powerful handgun in the world . you gotta ask yourself just one question . are you feelin' lucky ?
i still don't think it's loaded .
hey , you're right .
you're hopeless .
that's the way i see it , too .
i'm all wet .
what's wrong with that ?
a guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today .
what'd you do ?
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b i'd just poured him . then i tried to deck the sucker .
i guess he got the message .
then i sit back and i think , i mean , who's to say i'm not a dumb bitch . i work in a bar , right ? i can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze hound that comes in the place . you are what you do .
positive self image problem all over again . you are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you .
aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit ?
i do think all psychotherapy is bullshit . but just because i think it's bullshit doesn't mean i don't know something about it .
if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems , i'll take brutal indifference .
hey , you know what i really think ?
tell me i'm dyin' to hear it .
i think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear . you pull down four bills a week which is damn good , and you mix the best pina coladas i've ever had . i think that if you need bigger and better things . then go for em .
you know , if you let me come over to your place once in a while , you could put on a clean shirt in the morning .
what makes you think i have any clean shirts at my place ?
maybe i would if i knew when you were coming back .
maybe i got a fairly crummy day ahead .
maybe that makes a nice excuse .
maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about .
when you start with that attitude . it's like i don't know who you are .
what do you want to know ? what difference does it make ? i'm the guy in your bed the last three months . i make you feel good . you make me feel good . what the hell else do you want from a guy ?
i wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so i won't care for you . i wish you'd give me a little more of a chance .
that's the way i see it , too .
call me later .
you sure you want me to ?
yeah , for some reason , i'm sure .
thanks for the coffee .
i think you forgot this . hands him his wallet and badge .
guess people ought to know who i am .
great place for lunch .
yeah , one of my favorites .
you made the front page .
yeah , guess it must have been a slow news day .
jack , are you okay ?
sure , okay , fine , no problem . see , there's this kid in jail . first thing i got to do is go up and see what he knows .
look , spare me the macho bullshit about your gun .
bullshit ? i'll tell you about bullshit . my gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it . it isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people , my gun is .
look , jack , if you make everything your personal responsibility , you'll turn into a bad cop . it's not a practical way to function .
i didn't get burned , two cops did . listen , i'll tell you about personnel responsibility . i like to get the job done right . and if i don't get my job done right . i'm for shit .
here it comes again . the sacred job .
that's right . i'm not like you . i'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong . there's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and i'm gonna get him . because it's my job . and if you don't get that .
i get that . the job first . everything else , especially me , second . i get it . i don't like it .
elaine , look , i'm in the middle of sone stuff right now . i'm not gonna have time to come by . i don't know when i can get there .
this is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave .
elaine ! i . i'm sorry . i was expecting somebody else . police business .
no wonder you're so popular .
no , it's i'm just surprised you called .
so am i .
the number . what's the goddamn number ?
jack ? what was that ?
elaine , i gotta put you on hold .
jack , wait .
just a second , that's all !
hello .
hi , it's me .
fuck you .
hiya , kid .
i ought to have you and your friend thrown out .
don't . we've had a hard night .
i can see that . pardon me for saying so , but you look like shit . what happened ?
we and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours .
you real down ?
i've been better . dead end . no ganz , no indian .
ganz is going to be hard to track . just a pure schizo . wires all crossed . totally without any pattern . kill anybody . the indian . himself . anybody .
how do you know ?
jack , it's all over the papers . he's an obvious type . but this indian .
come on , they were a little old for a slumber party .
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions . i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week , jack , and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian . now , if this indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him , it could just be she's still vulnerable to him .
so what ?
when a guy hurts you , then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees , who knows , he might just be irrestible .
hey , come on , shrink time's over . they wouldn't go see some old girlfriend .
oh , yeah , well look where you came when you were down and out .
whaddya think ?
what do i know ? i'm just a bartender .
let's go , reggie .
how'd they take it back at headquarters ?
usual bullshit . you make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend . you know somethin' , shootin' guys sucks . especially compared to this .
i've been waiting a long time to hear you say that .
yeah , bein' a hard ass all the time is a real drag , but it works .
where is he ?
promised i'd turn my back while he . ah , never mind .
tell me .
he's takin' care of the same business i'll be takin' care of soon as i dry off .
you're impossible .
that's what i always say .
a cop .
i sure ain't his fairy godmother . now i'm looking for ganz . where is he ?
haven't seen him for years . that's the truth .
you just took a shot at me , asshole . i think you do know where he is .
who gives a fuck what you think ?
i think i met her . now tell us something we don't know , like where they stashed her .
i don't know .
when ? how ?
i dunno . he's gonna call me .
is that what this guy ganz had in the hotel ?
every last bit of it . the big guy's room was empty .
i'll help you out .
this guy must have had a . like yours , jack . now he's got yours .
shit .
backup man from the east bay . worked with ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang .
who are all these ?
they all pulled a bunch of jobs with ganz about four years ago .
wait a minute , wait a minute . who's this ?
uhh . wong , henry wong . he was in on the same job .
tell me that's not the same guy .
hey . dick tracy .
i think i wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking . can we find them ?
here's the file . cates checks the file .
one of em's in the slam .
you look awful .
so do you . been a long day .
long night , too , from what i heard . word's going around that in addition to losing ganz for the second time , and in addition to haden busting you back to patrolman , some jig beat the crap out of you .
aw , bullshit , you heard wrong .
doesn't look like it .
nothing came in for me yet ? no calls ?
nothing .
bullshit red tape .
i'm heading out . how about you ?
i got to wait for a call .
okay . see you in the morning . you know , you ought to get some rest .
what ?
i'm not paid to take your personal calls . he was in some bar . . off duty .
that's what you say , cates .
yeah .
but that's what you say about all of us all the tine . we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it .
the truth hurts , doesn't it , buddy ?
somebody steals your gun , you're supposed to file a report .
are you gonna tell me about police procedure ? do me a favor , don't give me a bunch of crap .
i guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible .
i want to be left alone on this one . algren was killed with my gun .
yeah , i read the report .
hey , the bastard's got my gun . i want it back .
jack , come on , there is an official department policy about cop killings . cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian . in other words , we can't seen like we're in the revenge business . i know , we all know the truth's a little different .
yeah .
anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun ?
yeah . it bothers me when cops get hurt while i'm makin' a play . i don't like it .
you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one , jack .
being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far . besides , i got a lead .
okay . you're not a team player . you gotta do things your own way . fine . nail this guy and make us all look good . but you better watch your ass . if you screw up , i can promise you , you're goin' down .
you really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude . he starts to go .
jack ?
yeah ?
try not to get your ass shot to pieces . we got enough dead cops on this one .
i'll keep it in mind .
what the bell happened ?
i lost them , that's what happened .
how did they get away ?
they ran . as fast as they could . caught a train .
which one pulled the trigger ?
the indian . i was about yards away .
you couldn't get to him ?
right . i screwed up . i fucked up . i messed up . anybody could have done better , especially you . i bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds .
don't duck the bullet cates . why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play ?
i didn't have the time .
too bad , it would've covered your ass . now you're in the shit and so's the department . in case you haven't noticed , this wasn't our finest hour . i told you everyone was watchin' on this one . maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike .
he's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop i've worked with .
just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me . how you gonna take to a pink slip , huh ? .
i'm taking my prisoner back to jail .
you got a name , cop ?
try cates . and let's talk in private , okay ?
sure , anything you want .
not likely , reggie . maybe i just need some help .
ganz is in jail . he's gonna be there two years after i'm on the street .
didn't work out that way . he busted out with a big indian . they capped two guards on a road gang . nice meeting you reggie .
i can deliver ganz . but you gotta get me outta here first .
you're crazy .
i can help you , man , but you gotta get me out . i got to be on the street . get me outta here .
what's the big deal about you bein' on the street ?
i got a lot to protect .
bullshit .
it's the only way you're gonna get ganz .
i'll think about it .
what are you talkin' about ? this suit's mine . it cost .
we're supposed to be after a killer , not a string of hookers .
listen , it may be a little out of date . you know , i got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies .
i don't need to hear your jive . i already got that department taken care of .
you got a girl . shit . the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me .
you just don't get it , do your reggie ? there isn't any deal . i own your ass .
no way to start a partnership .
get this . we ain't partners . we ain't brothers . we ain't friends . i'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until ganz is locked up or dead . and if ganz gets away , you're gonna be sorry we ever met .
shit . i'm already sorry .
yeah .
it looks like you bought it off one of the brothers .
okay , let's get down to it . i did my part and got you out . so now you tell me where we're goin' ?
don't worry , i got a move for ya . an awesome move . a guy named luther . ganz'll be paying him a visit . we go to him right away .
luther was part of the gang ?
what gang you talkin' about , jack ?
i can read a police file , shithead , and quit calling me jack .
just an expression man , don't mean nothin' .
i don't give a damn . it happens to be my name .
then what're you complainin' about ? at least nobody's calling you shithead .
i may call you worse than that .
just up the street , the other side , over there . now , don't bother knockin' on the door . luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company .
your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me ?
luther ain't the reliable type . i don't want you shot yet , cates . not before you been a help to me .
i'm helpin' you , huh ?
quit playin' cop and undo this cuff , jack , i need to talk to this man .
i'm tellin' you to drop the goddam gun .
i got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me .
just throw me the goddamn gun .
thank you .
want to try it again ?
i think you better put him on ice , man .
he's gotta take that call . if there is one .
if you let him run around till tuesday , he's gonna run right to ganz and warn him . ain't you , motherfucker ?
we're on the move . let's go . as they walk toward a corridor .
do you know how close i was to getting some trim . and you fucked' it up .
yeah , well , my ass bleeds for you . and i didn't get you out so you could go on a goddamn trim hunt . stop moaning .
speakin' of moans my stomach is startin' to growl .
we eat when i say we eat .
bullshit . i ain't moving till i get something to eat . you've been treating me like shit ever since i came out here . if you don't like it , you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good bye . and i want some food some place nice . some good people , nice music .
yeah , i'm hungry too . i know of a place . let's go eat .
yeah , i want mandolins , flowers . they move off down the corridor .
just get in the car and keep your mouth shut .
you really do have onoe , huh , jack . what's her problem besides you ?
she's got the same complaint as half the goddamn population . she can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off . anyway , what the fuck do you care ?
mission district . gonna find us an indian .
i don't give out the details .
last night , two nights ago , three ?
last night .
you have a good time ?
sure . then we had a fight this morning .
at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you . tell me a little about her . she got great tits ?
well ?
it's a long shot , but . billy used to tend bar here a few years back . i heard him talk about it .
this part of town , they'll make us for heat the second we walk in . just back me up like you've got a piece .
back you up ? now why would i wanna do that ?
if they kick my ass , they'll sure as hell carve yours up .
but you can handle it all right , huh ? real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats .
bullshit . attitude and experience get you through .
i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers . all those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge .
you need five years training to handle a joint like .
hey , you wanna bet ?
i got two problems . number one , i'm not playin' games . number two , you got nothin' to bet with .
if we come outta this joint with ganz' phone number , or a dead indian , or anything else useful , then you could turn the other way for half an hour while i get laid .
why ? anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway .
that's never been one of my problems .
i'll tell you what happens if you lose . you tell the truth for once .
what are you talkin' about ?
you tell me what ganz busted out for , he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail . and whatever it is , you're part of it .
i don't know what you're talking about . i just wanna see ganz nailed .
the bet's off .
i thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes .
my kind of place . i always liked country boys .
that wasn't necessary , buddy . i got this under control .
some of us citizens are with you all the way , officer .
you made that move , huh ?
while you're at it , you can give me the switchblade , too .
must be billy's girl .
come on .
wait a minute . maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us . how about it ? i been nearly three years in prison and .
this sucks . a maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it . so , instead of me being where i oughta be , which is in bed giving my girl the high , hard one , i'm out here doing this shit , roaming around with some overdressed , charcoal colored loser like you .
you wanna leave , man ? let me take care of ganz all by myself .
you ? don't make me laugh . you can't take care of shit . you've been dicking me around since we started on this turd hunt . all you're good for is games . so far , what i got outta you is nothin' .
i'm impressed with you too , jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night .
luther knew more than he told me and so do you . now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about . i gave you hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' .
maybe i don't like the way you ask .
who gives a goddamn what you think ? you're just a crook that's got a weekendpass . you're not even a name anymore . just a spear chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues .
naw , you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time .
they saved your ass , convict .
one thing's for sure , jack . that's how you'll tell the story .
how much ?
half a million .
jesus .
me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale . it's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen . i was sittin' pretty , livin' in the high cotton , then somebody fingered me for another job . . some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun .
he's after your money .
you catch on real fast . okay , jack , let's talk deal . how much of my money you gonna let me keep ?
not likely , convict .
you gonna let me keep any of it ?
depends on how things work out . i believe in the merit system . so far you haven't built up any points .
in the trunk of a car . a lot better than under a mattress , right ?
right , partner .
get this . we ain't partners . we ain't brothers . we ain't friends . if ganz gets away with my money , you're gonna be sorry we ever met .
yeah . right .
you're a real case , you know that , jack ?
. for three years ? let's hope it wasn't a tow away zone .
you just drove by it .
you son of a bitch . you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait . i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing .
i wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw luther . you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once , not twice , jack .
shit .
not really . i figured ganz was put down for a long time . and i knew luther would never job me on his own . he's too chickenshit .
guess what ? luther just got in line .
what ?
musta got some primo bondsman .
jesus christ . that's a disgrace the guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in hours . i tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door .
didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs .
i had no choice . some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue cadillac .
you'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed .
tryin' to save his girl , man . he's in another world .
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass , i'd just leave town .
i'm tellin' you the man's in love . he wants to be a hero for his girl .
oh , yeah , does bein' in love make you stupid ?
i let women get to me . the quest for pussy is the meaning of life . i got my own personal philosophy about 'em . keep women separate from guns , money and business . women are for spending money . they got nothing to do with helping you make it .
that ain't philosophy . that's common sense .
say , do you always work people over like you did luther ?
if they don't tell me what i need to know .
doesn't it get . tiring ?
i'm not in this 'cause it's fun . i'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either . i do it 'cause it works .
you got a very depressing view of life , man . you gotta smile once in awhile .
maybe luther hopes ganz'll give him a piece of your money .
if he's hoping that then he's dumber than i think he is , which would be amazin' , cause i already think he's real dumb .
yeah , it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy .
you know , i'd be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way you've done with this job .
what you don't understand is , i don't give a damn about how this thing looks .
no class .
class isn't somethin' you buy , punk . look at you , five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife .
we're getting too close . cates , what's the matter , you been takin' dumb pills ?
yeah , most cops are pretty dumb . but since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you ?
that was in style a couple years back , man .
right . if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping , then you're all set .
bullshit . then i'm staying with the money .
you stay with me .
no way .
i'll be there in a minute . you don't move your ass , right ?
be polite . say hello . this is candy .
hello . and goodbye .
what about ganz ?
we missed .
you missed . luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street . made a phone call .
maybe we should pay luther a visit .
let him get some sleep . he's going to need it .
so you took the rest of the night off .
forget it . i want ganz as bad as you do and i got some other news for you .
i don't know why , but i'm going to let you keep it . maybe because you told me you had it , or maybe just because i'm too tired to argue .
you sure that's the reason ?
thanks for callin' in . and i guess maybe . look , i'm sorry i called you watermellon nigger . those kinds of things . i was just leanin' on ya , doin' my job .
bein' good at your job don't explain everything , jack .
yeah . guess not .
i can just take her right across the street to luther's hotel . all i need is some money for the room .
that was quick .
when you been in prison three years , it don't take long . let's go .
why ?
luther's on the move .
yeah . it missed the last four stops .
hey , how'd my car get here ?
i had it impounded . come on , we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam .
back to jail in my own car . ganz got away . got all my money . it just don't seem right .
i don't know about you , but i could use a drink . i'll buy you one . it'll be my good bye present .
sorry we didn't do better , jack . i feel like i let you down .
naw , you didn't let me down . it was a long shot all the way . we gave 'em a good run at it .
yeah , but we didn't get 'em .
don't worry about it .
yeah , too bad . they were real nice lookin' too . in bed together , hardly any clothes one watching tv .
if she's right , and if you don't screw up .
what if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit ? i mean , they could be in rio de janeiro .
i've got to play it rough with them . if they know anything , i'm gonna know it .
hey , there she is .
whatever play i maker just back me up .
if we run into billy first , let me try and talk him in .
sure , i'll give you a shot at it , but ganz is mine . you know , that big indian plays it for keeps .
yeah , and i know ganz sure ain't no sweetheart . i wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started .
partnership ?
well , you got to admit we come a long way .
you okay ?
yeah . but i wasn't there for a second .
you did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own .
hey , jack , real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit . but i was fantastic .
there's nothin' to talk about .
and you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash ?
that's right . not my style , reggie .
you are an awesomely weird cop . sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here .
no , you don't . if i ever get word of you steppin' over the line again , i'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours .
spare met jack . i'm into legit investments from here on in .
thanks .
no trouble , jack . but , listen , suppose i stay a crook ? where'd you get the idea that you could catch me ?
you lying son of a bitch .
what are you talking about ? we didn't kill her .
i don't think you're gonna make it .
whaddya mean . i got your gun . i got his money . i got everything .
you're done . end of story .
i ain't gonna beg for my life . it ain't cool .
i said police . now drop the goddamn gun .
don't give me that police shit . you drop it .
how about it ?
i used to go with him . i don't know where the hell he is . i haven't seen him for two weeks . and i don't think i will . he owes me money .
i hear you've got visitors .
would you guys .
no time for any of that crap any more , lady . i'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast .
yeah . sure , i'm crazy in love with him , who wouldn't be .
you're gonna help us take him .
no chance .
he can live or die . you let us in and he's got a chance to make it . otherwise , he gets ventilated .
in the back . down the other corridor .
i'm candy .
excuse me , baby , but if i don't get some action tonight , i'm gonna bust . you interested ?
hey , what kind of talk is that ?
oh . you're a schoolteacher .
no , i go to a school to learn how to do hair . it's a government program . but really i want to be a model and i am definitely not sellin' .
goodbye .
hey , don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on ?
here you go sweetheart , throw it my way .
you're in a hurry .
yeah , i been waiting three years .
you just quit bein' a priest or somethin' ?
no , baby , nothin' like that . look , there's a place across the street . we can go right over there .
what's the matter with my place ?
no , it's gotta be here and now . believe me . only i don't have the damn money for a room .
well , maybe i'll see you later .
here's hoping , baby .
hello , again .
i just struck it rich . i think we can do a little business . as a matter of fact , i think we can have a party .
hey , don't do that . i said i wasn't a pro , remember ?
hey , no , i'm tryin' to be nice . buy yourself something pretty . i'd do it , but i got to go . i got this cop waitin' for me .
now you're talkin' . see ya .
maybe you shoulda stole a better truck , tonto .
you got a real big mouth , convict .
i want to drive awhile .
i ain't tired yet .
maybe after we get done with him i'm gonna buy us some girls .
whaddya mean , buy ?
pros .
pay money ?
yeah , dummy . money .
i never paid for it in my life .
it's better when you pay . they let you do anything .
they always let me do anything . i don't want to pay for it . i never paid for it in my life .
just do what i say , okay ? we'll pay for the girls and have a good time . don't you trust me ?
he's just kiddin' , you just keep doin' what i tell ya , you'll be okay .
and i need one more for my pal . yeah . make her an indian . no , not a turban , you know , a squaw .
yeah .
vodka .
maybe you better have a black russian .
no , man , i think i'll have a vodka .
fuck off . i don't know what the hell you're talkin' about .
maybe i better ask around , see what your pals think .
i don't give a shit who you ask .
i don't give a damn about his girl .
look , give me a break , you're going to have to settle for her place . it's the only thing i know .
try obeyin' the law once in awhile , and i won't have to hassle you .
yeah ?
i want to pick up my car .
name ?
hammond .
this is three years old .
yeah , i've been busy .
we don't wash 'em , ya know .
how about chargin' the battery ?
that we do . and we put air in the tires . i'll even sell you some gas if you need it .
great , just great .
i will if i can , frank .
our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn . true or false ?
true .
our transit time is days . is that true ?
that's true .
approximately five years after we go into hibernation , the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back . is this true ?
that's true
there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program , and to further our general knowledge of the planets . is that true ?
that's true .
thank you very much , hal .
roger .
hal , i'm going out now to replace the a . o . unit .
i understand .
hal , maintain normal e . v . a . condition .
roger .
hal , check all airlock doors secure .
pod bay is decompressed . all doors are secure . you are free to open pod bay doors .
opening pod bay doors .
it looks like we have another bad a . o . unit . my fpc shows another impending failure .
let me see the tracking alignment display .
not really , frank . i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure .
all right , hal . we'll take care of it . let me have the hard copy , please .
oh , marvellous . it's the first real sleep i've had for the past two days .
there's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest .
when do we arrive at clavius ?
we're scheduled to dock in about seven hours . is there anything we can do for you ?
oh , no , thank you . the two girls have taken wonderful care of me . i'm just fine .
incidentally , dr . floyd , i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ?
what do you mean ?
well . the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius . we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twenty four hours . and then we're going to back empty .
i see .
i take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at clavius ?
i see . well , i'm sorry about that . i wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm .
yes , well , i wouldn't have been too concerned about it , except i've heard these stories about the epidemic and , as a matter of fact , i've heard that ten people have died already .
no , of course , captain , i can understand your concern .
well , thank you very much , and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable .
dr . floyd , how long do you think this can be kept under wraps ?
i'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council . and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event . there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement .
yes , it does . the sub surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago .
how can you tell it was deliberately buried ?
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill .
any clue as to what it is ?
not really . it's completely inert . no sound or energy sources have been detected . the surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it . a laser drill
but you don't have any idea as to what it is ?
tomb , shine , survey marker spare part , take your choice .
any ideas about the colour ?
well , not really . at first glance , black would suggest something sun powered , but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device ?
has it been exposed to any sun before now ?
i don't think it has , but i'd like to check that . simpson , what's the log on that ?
oh , i really don't have time for a drink . if it's all right i'll just sit for a minute and then i've got to be off .
are you quite sure ?
yes , really , thank you very much .
are you , by any chance , going up to your base at clavius ?
yes , as a matter of fact , i am .
well , it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius .
really ?
yes . well , for one thing , whenever you phone the base , all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order .
you mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?
that's right .
i see .
yes , and i'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it . denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the i . a . s . convention .
yes . well , i hope the crew got back safely .
fortunately , they did .
well , i'm glad about that .
dr . floyd , at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss , may i ask you a straightforward question ?
certainly .
quite frankly , we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius . something , apperently , of an unknown origin . is this , in fact , what has happened ?
dr . smyslov . i'm not permitted to discuss this .
i'm terribly sorry . i was just on my way down to meet you . i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time , and i was on my way out of the office when , suddenly , the phone rang .
please , it really doesn't matter .
well . did you have a pleaant flight ?
yes , very pleasant .
well , shall we go through documentation ?
fine .
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking .
yes , it's coming along very well .
and your charming little daughter ?
oh , she's growing up very fast . as a matter of fact , she's six tomorrow .
oh , that's such a delightful age .
how is gregor ?
he's fine . but i'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days .
well , where are all of you off to ?
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal .
well , that does sound very odd .
are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink ?
no , thank you . and i'm afraid now i really must be going .
well , i hope that you and your wife can come to the i . a . c . conference in june .
thank you . it's been a great pleasure to meet all of you . dr . smyslov .
oh , thank you very much .
thank you .
well , how's it going back there ?
well , i've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic .
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight .
yes , well , whatever it is , they're certainly not fooling around . this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week .
i was working out what this trip must cost , taking him up there by himself and coming back empty .
i'll bet it's a fortune .
i'm at space station five , darling . how are you ?
i'm fine , daddy . when are you coming home ?
yes , i know that sweetheart .
are you coming to my party ?
no , i'm sorry , darling , i told you i won't be home for a few days .
when are you coming home ?
in three days , darling , i hope .
mommy's out to the hair dresser .
where is mrs . brown ?
she's in the bathroom .
okay , sweetheart . well , i have to go now . tell mommy that i called .
how many days until you come home ?
three , darling . one . two . three . be sure to tell mommy i called .
thank you , daddy .
i'll wish you a happy birthday now and i'll see you soon . all right , darling ?
yes , daddy .
'bye , 'bye , now , sweetheart .
goodbye , daddy .
continued
yes , i remember you mentioning it . i got mine about the same time .
continued
did they have any explanation for this ?
continued
well , what is it ?
coninued
well . it's silly , but . if you want to , why don't you ?
continued
still , you really don't believe it , do you ?
continued
well , the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going , what will we do when we get there , when are we coming back , and . why are we going ?
i'm sorry , frank , but i don't think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know .
he's got a point .
sorry to interrupt the festivities , dave , but i think we've got a problem .
what is it , hal ?
my f . p . c . shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit .
i understand hal . we'll take care of it . please , let me have the hard copy .
sure , dave , what's up ?
you know that we checked the two ao units that you reported in imminent failure condition ?
yes , i know .
you probably also know that we found them okay .
yes , i know that . but i can assure you that they were about to fail .
hal , is there anything bothering you ? anything that might account for this problem ?
look , dave , i know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job , and that you're trying to be helpful , but i can assure the problem is with the ao units , and with your test gear .
okay , hal , well let's see the way things go from here on .
naturally , dave , i'm not pleased that the ao unit has failed , but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability . i certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected , even temporarily , as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history .
i'm sorry about the misunderstanding , hal .
well , don't worry about it .
and don't you worry about it .
is your confidence in me fully restored ?
yes , it is , hal .
well , that's a relief . you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission .
yes , it is .
i suppose you're pretty broken up about it ?
the antenna has to be replaced .
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation .
it doesn't have to be , hal . it's more dangerous to be out of touch with earth . let me have manual control , please .
i don't really agree with you , dave . my on board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements .
i'm goin to do this myself , hal . let me have the control , please .
look , dave your've probably got a lot to do . i suggest you leave it to me .
hal , switch to manual hibernation control .
i don't like to assert myself , dave , but it would be much better now for you to rest . you've been involved in a very stressful situation .
hal , i'm in command of this ship . i order you to release the manual hibernation control .
i'm sorry , dave , but in accordance with sub routine c , quote , when the crew are dead or incapacitated , the computer must assume control , unquote . i must , therefore , override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it .
hal , unless you follow my instructions , i shall be forced to disconnect you .
i know that you've had that on your mind for some time now , dave , but it would be a crying shame , since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are , and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission .
listen to me very carefully , hal . unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on , i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection .
right . just a sec .
okay .
okay , come on down .
sure , what is it ?
well , it's nothing really important , but it's annoying .
what's up ?
it's about my salary cheques .
yes ?
well i got the papers on my official up grading to ags two weeks before we left .
interesting that you mention it , because i've got the same problem .
really .
yes .
yesterday , i finally called the accounting office at mission control , and all they could tell me was that they'd received the ags notification for the other three but not mine , and apparently not yours either .
it's possible .
well , what do you think we ought to do about it ?
i don't think we should make any fuss about it yet . i'm sure they'll straighten it out .
i must say , i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training .
no . i never did , either .
i suppose so . though , of course , there's a more sinister explanation .
oh ?
yes . you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check out .
no , as a matter of fact , i didn't .
oh , well , apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know , and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard .
that seems very unlikely .
yes , i thought so .
of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now .
how ?
just ask hal . it's conceivable they might keep something from us , but they'd never keep anything from hal .
that's true .
yes , but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us .
i know . it would be almost inconceivable .
but not completely inconceivable ?
i suppose it isn't logically impossible .
i guess it isn't .
still , all we have to do is ask hal .
well , that's something .
yes , i don't know what to make of it .
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong .
yes , but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low .
anyway , it's just as well that we replace it . better safe than sorry .
are you reasonably awake ?
oh , i'm fine , i'm wide awake . what's up ?
well . hal's reported the ao unit about to fail again .
you're kidding .
no .
two units in four days . how many spares do we have ?
two more .
well , i hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those . other wise we're out of business .
hal ?
yes .
it's the last one .
well , now that we've got one that's actually failed , we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it .
i guess you don't know your own strength , old boy .
i guess not .
i think i'll have to go out and burn them off .
roger .
space stattion lounge
well , how nice to see you again , elena . you're looking wonderful .
continued
i'm afraid i've only got a few minutes , but i'd love to .
continued
she's wonderful .
continued
well , i suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment .
continued
how did they manage to do that without any communication ?
continued
i'm sorry , dr . smyslov , but i'm really not at liberty to discuss this .
continued
we're trying to get there . i hope we can .
your doctor ?
yes . my psychiatrist didn't insist that i stay on my medication .
. so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people ?
it was my finger that pulled the trigger , but i'm not morally responsible . my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of . how could i know . i'm not a doctor .
you seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial .
look , i'm a victim here , too . i was a year away from getting my masters in art , now i'll never graduate . my life has been permanently disrupted .
permanently disrupted ? aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ? hasn't this 'incident' as you call it , jump started your career as an artist ?
look , i'm in here . you call this a career move ?
and isn't there a movie in the works about you ?
we're in negotiations , that's correct .
but doesn't the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes ?
that doesn't apply to me because i'm not a criminal . i'm not a criminal ! i wasn't convicted .
room was registered to a francis capra .
capra ? that's not czech or russian . who said he sounded russian ?
the clerk ?
don't you get it ? he knew he was gonna get caught ! that's why he videotaped eddie's murder he thinks he's gonna get off .
don't stoop to his level !
take the car . get outta here , tommy .
look , you can't shoot him in cold blood .
get outta here now ! get in that car and drive away ! do what i say or i'll kill you , too !
where you been , man ? we got a celebrity !
i heard . who the hell let them up there ?
i don't know , you think eddie will give me his autograph ?
you see anything in the crowd ? anybody suspicious ?
naw i'm sure the suspect's not here .
oh yeah , why ?
'cause eddie woulda locked him up by now !
could you put out the cigar ? part of the job is picking up scents .
clean ?
don't blow your nose !
but you knew that , right ?
he knew all along .
what ?
that's why he was so quiet . he was testing us .
what ?
there was a woman i think she wanted to talk to us . she looked scared . oh shit ! oh no !
yeah ?
maybe you can be his stand in .
from czechoslovakia ? and how long have they been livin' in your building ? alright , i'll be in touch when we know somethin' . milos and tamina karlova . they were quiet and kept to themselves . landlord don't know who your girl is .
how long they been livin' here ?
you hear that question , garcia ?
you go home . i'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene .
aren't you tired ?
if i go home i won't be able to fall asleep anyway .
it hurts . aw , jesus !
lay down . stay down , bobby .
how was it ?
not good .
what the hell happened ?
they were inside . they booby trapped her apartment !
yeah , i'm religious . i'm not an atheist like you ! now , are you guys gonna arrest me , or not ?

look , i don't have time for you , get out of my way !
alright , how 'bout all your fuckin' money ?
okay , you're under arrest ! now you happy ?
fire department ? firemen don't carry guns .
oh yeah ? guess again .
hey . c'mon , you can't leave me like this . some freak'll come by and stab me !
you okay ?
a dog pissed on me ! i'm gonna sue you for this ! you violated my civil rights !
your civil rights ? ! you tried to rob me ! i could arrest you right now ! you're lucky you're walking away from this . now get outta here .
no . go ahead .
thanks . appreciate it .
that's what it looks like to me .
and while they're burning up , they're still goin' down on each other ? you got to hand it to them .
yeah , well , some people got their priorities straight .
evidence . of a homicide .
i'll take him .
no way ! he's mine !

isn't he a little moody ?
of course he's moody . he thinks he's in love .
in love ? with who ?
yeah ?
paulie , you've got kids , right ?
and you , you'll pay for what you did !
this footage will work in your favor . when the jury sees this no matter what cutler tries , they'll convict him .

what is it ?
the video of milos and tamina i told you to erase it .
i did .
and the whore's murder ? you didn't erase that either , did you ? don't lie , i won't be angry .
why not ?
put the camera down , oleg .
what is that ?
what does it look like ? it's an address book !
let me get a shot of it .
sit down !
this way . hold it this way . good .
no . we are insane . who else but crazy men would film their murders ? so we kill someone famous and if we are caught , we are sent to mental hospital . but what good is money there ? because once in hospital i say i not crazy . just pretended to be acquitted . we see psychiatrists . they must certify we are sane and because of your what is law called ? oh i got it . because of your double jeopardy law , we can't be tried for same crime twice . we come out free , rich and famous !
good idea !

credit ?
yes . before we hand in the next video i put titles on it and my credit is going to read directed by oleg razgul .

detective , does it look like a murder ?
we don't know that yet . it's much too early . there's a lot to be done .
how many victims are up there ?
there are two bodies found at this point .
can we go up to the crime scene ?
you know you can't do that . c'mon .
is it drug related ?
we don't know . when i have more i'll let you know .
detective can you tell us what happened here ?
i can't talk right now . we have some things to take care of .
i understand , but i noticed that the fire marshall is here with you . is this somehow related to the fire department ?
i really can't give out any information right now at this point .
okay . but i do understand that your partner , leon jackson's been injured . is that correct ?
he was hurt , but not seriously . he'll be fine .
do you have the suspect in custody ?
um . now is not a good time , okay . detective jackson's hurt . he's fine . i've got a fire marshall shot , detective jackson is hurt but not seriously .

you didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues . you could give me something .
oh , i'm sorry . did i embarrass you , sweetheart ? oh .
stop it .
maybe i should just , ya know . turn to the cameras and say , do you mind if we just work something out ?
alright , alright , eddie . don't patronize me .
i'm not .
yes you are . i'm not just some reporter . i don't just stick a microphone in your face . you could give me something .
yeah , well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence . that was .
that was good . you were holding the evidence .
you were merciless . you didn't give a shit if you got me or not .
well , who was it that taught me how to do that ? huh ?
you're ruthless .
you're not so bad yourself .
could be leon's .
jesus . and last week you came over with blood on your shoes . what am i going to do with you ?
answer the phone .
no . tell me what you want to say .

okay .
see you later . good luck .
thank you .
don't be late .
so . who's nicky ?
what do you want ?
your opinion . you see , they going to make a movie about me , too , eddie . and write books .
what's your accomplishment .
i kill someone famous .
then do it , asshole .
good be tough to the end . actor who plays you will want to die like hero .
if you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck .
smarter than americans . you're fed cry baby talk shows all day long . not only will americans believe me , they'll cry for me . so . detective eddie flemming , would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette ? maybe you can propose to her now ?
hey , that's great you guys got it all wrapped up , but you don't mind if we go through the routine ? it gives us somethin' to do .
no , we don't mind . you mind leon ?
you know what that is , right ?
no , what is it ?
why don't you explain it , bobby . hey camello ! you mind punching a hole in the floor ?

nah , why should you ?
i don't even watch tv .
good . good . commendable .
did you get a report from the m . e . ?
sure . but i would like to ask you something . you got a problem with me ?
if you found me steppin' on your crime scene it might piss you off , too . what about the report ?
you were right , they were both dead before the fire . the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine . that's usually an indicator of something personal .
the super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here .
pretty .
hmmmm .
maybe you don't care about that either . prettiest suspect i've had in awhile .
who says she's a suspect ?
what would you call her ?
look , i'm not even sure she has anything to do with this . i saw her outside after the fire thought it was a lead . maybe she saw something . maybe she was visiting somebody here . who knows ?
eastern europe . like what ? romania ? hungary ?
or czechoslovakia . the slavs have been fighting the germans and the russians for a thousand years . these are very intense people and they take things personally .
there wasn't a fire . there'll be nothing for you to do .
i can watch you , eddie . maybe i'll learn something .
this isn't homicide school .
my parents are from poland . i can help with the eastern european angle .
you're polish ?
my folks are .
stay here .
you goin' to the escort service ?
you got any better ideas ?
mind if i ride along with you ?
this has nothing to do with your fire .
but what if it does ? you might need my help .
i'll let you know what happens .
this is ridiculous . i'm not gonna be in your way we can talk the case over .
tell you what i'll flip you a coin . if you win you can come with me . if you don't win , you don't come .
i'll call it . tails .
better than one .
i'm on my way with eddie . ludwig's . rd and madison . the suspects might be there already .
you thirsty ?
i'm on duty .
so am i . alright , i'll go inside and you cover the back .
of course .
hey ! i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid . i dreamed of running up to a door , kicking it in , pulling my gun and yelling 'freeze ! ' at the bad guy ! what'd you dream about ?
i wanted to run up to a building on fire , kick in the door , rush into the smoke and save a kid .
then i guess we're doin' this the right way , aren't we ? if we pull up to a burning building i'll gladly let you go first .
she just saw two of her friends killed ! they probably threatened her .
is that all there is ?
why not ?
something back home ?
raw deal .
you wanna talk to her alone ?
yeah .
what would your girlfriend think of that ?
i don't have a girlfriend .
my point exactly .
i'm serious here .
so am i .
c'mon . you intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity . she sees me differently .
you're her savior ? is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building ?
you know what i'm saying here .
okay , tell you what , i'll give you a head start . you take her to the station house . don't let her out of your sight . she's the only warm body we got left .
hey . i'm a professional .
women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs .
look , eddie , i'm tellin' you i didn't touch her .
well , you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't . including me .
i took her there for a shower and that's it .
just a shower ?
yeah , just her in the shower . nothing happened . look , i'm sure you probably think i'm a fool and i fucked up , but .
no , i don't think you were a fool , i just think you were stupid about it . i mean , to say the least , you outta know better . you don't know her well enough . she's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her , it's fuckin' over . you can deny it all you want , but it will not make one fucking bit of difference . you're dead .
i told you , you know , i thought i was doing the right thing , you know , i think she's innocent .
well , it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not . don't you understand , that's why you're a professional .
but , i mean , didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody ? i mean , you shoulda heard her there . tellin' her whole story . i believed her .
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer . here , here's a number of an immigration lawyer . that's how you help her . but you can't get involved in her like that . you're gonna jeopardize your career , your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case . and lemme give you another piece of advice . maybe you don't watch tv but i'll let you in on a little secret the whole fuckin' world watches television . and when you get out there , they know your face . and the little fame , the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job . and i get more done because of it .
why'd you help me back there with the chief ? why'd you stand up for me like that ?
you know , i don't know . i like you . you remind me of a puppy i used to have . he pissed on the rug all the time , but i still kept him .
who's there ?
police . we'd like to ask you a few questions .
i have nothin' to say . if you wanna contact my attorney .
homicide , miss hearn . it's detective eddie flemming . open up .
what's wrong ?
we don't have her i . d . yet , but one of your girls was killed last night at the king edward hotel .
oh my g d . honey ! honey's dead ?
do you have any czech girls working for you ?
no .
did you tell him you did ?
boy , she's so popular all the sudden .
what are you saying ?
daphne . another guy came in asking me about her , too .
describe him .
tall , short haired , scary eyes . second guy with him was . shorter , with a wrestler's build . and he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me .
he had a videocamera ? where is she ? quickly !
she washes hair up at ludwig's a salon on rd and madison .
coffee for me , i gotta slow down .
vodka tonic .
maybe you could just put in a shot of martell ?
what's the kid gonna say sorry ? meanwhile i'm not here anymore . like last week we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up spleen here liver there his heart in a pan . six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk . who knows ? but some kid's robbed him for or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and i'm thinkin' that's me . sooner or later . that's me .
when ?
tomorrow . at lunch .
you ready ?
a timer .
takin' a bath .
any i . d . ?
still unknown but we're running prints . kid over there caught the case .
it's okay .
yeah .
c'mere . you wanna go to homicide school ? here make yourself useful .
stay with her .
are you hit ?
no . i'm okay .
i know . relax . take it easy . don't worry , we'll get those fuckers .
don't you guys understand ? it's all about image . the better we look the more money i get to pay you guys overtime .
yeah , right .
what was that , korfin ?
i said , yeah , you're right , chief . as soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media .
you do that , wiseguy . now let's solve this thing before eddie flemming does .
yeah . he finished awhile ago .
alright . swing by her apartment . let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to hoover street . you got that ?
yeah .
who did cause and origin ?
who do you think , chief ? !
then why didn't you talk to the reporter ?
'cause we got more important things to do , like finding out who did it .
i came to see how the investigation was going . i called and you're not here . i wait up at the station and you don't even show up ! i beep you you don't return my call . where the hell have you been ? !
ladder was on the rock for training . we stopped there . so she could get cleaned up .
what do you mean , 'cleaned up ? '
i let her take a shower .
a shower ! ? did you take one , too ?
no ! nothing happened .
oh really . that's nice . you took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot ? are you out of your fucking mind ? are you having that much trouble gettin' dates ? !
chief mind if i take her ?
okay . but not water sports .
what was i supposed to do ? the guy tried to mug me . i was gonna send a cop back i just forgot .
forgot ? you handcuffed a civilian to a tree ? !
chief i know i screwed up but this guy was no innocent civilian .
well this is gonna end your career and probably mine .
end my career ?
how are you going to fight this ? maybe if oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page , as a hero , this thing would be easier to fight . you'd have the good to weight against the bad ! it's unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing i can do ! gimme your shield .
but chief ? over this ?
there's nothing to talk about . get a good lawyer . you're suspended until your trial .
it was my decision , not his .
well , i'm the deputy chief fire marshall and every now and then i'd like to be included in decisions .
look , after jordy briefs me , you can do the press conference . how about that ? the case is all yours .
oh yeah . ? alright .
i'm ready to be briefed . excuse us .
yeah , sure . beep me when you're ready for the press conference .
i told your partner , i can't help . i didn't see anything .
c'mon , start at the beginning . you know these people ?
tamina was a friend of mine . my shower was broken , she let me use theirs .
go on .
if i tell you , will you arrest me ?
arrest you for what ? why would we arrest you ?
no , no , don't talk to immigration !
a cop ?
i'm from a small town in slovakia . like the south here . the police is right , a civilian is wrong . so i fled .
look , we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here . tell us the truth . is that the truth ?
you're a cop you'll never believe me .
alright . that's a justifiable homicide .
yes , but he was a cop .
if you cooperate with the da maybe they'll help you with your situation .
i will if they don't send me back .
they won't until this is over .
are you married ?
divorced .
do you live alone ? i've been in these clothes since . the killings . could we stop at your place ? i could take a shower . before i go into custody ?
i can't take you to my place .
somewhere else ?
the men are out of quarters practicing putting out fires .
so . the station is empty ?
yeah . this way .
yes , i considered it .
did you ever turn tricks before ?
no .
what about back home ?
no .
so you were never a prostitute ?
what are you asking me ?
i'm just trying to find out who you are .
i'm not a whore . i'm not a whore .
i know .
you don't know . i'm sorry . i was desperate . that's not me . i shot a cop . can you imagine what they'll do to me when i got to prison ?
they're not gonna send you right back .
i'm sorry . i didn't mean to . i'm glad . actually i'm glad it's over . all this time . hiding . never being able to look anyone in the eyes . always afraid that someone would find out who i was . never trusting anyone .
i still can't believe eddie's gone .
i'm sorry .
is he your boyfriend ?
ludwig ? he's gay are you jealous ?
if i was your boyfriend , i might be .
if you were my boyfriend , i'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten thousand miles away .
a good immigration lawyer could stall the process . eddie recommended one .
no matter what happens . i'm glad i met you .
i'm glad i met you .
right .
do you have coffee ?
in the kitchen .
i'll make some for us .
i'll get my clothes .
what are you doing ?
pouring it out !
. do you really want me to forget about you ?
i don't want to drag you down with me .
daphne , i .
are you my attorney ? i'm emil . i'm insane .
i'm not your lawyer until i see the money .
here . i have your money .
emil . take it easy . stay with me . sit down . what do you need ? what are you looking for ?
he has the camera ! he took the movie !
don't say anything .
where are we going ?
i'm coming with you .
yes . yes , come with me !
i'm invoking rights this man is represented by counsel . i'm coming with him .
you bring the cigarettes ?
oh , sure .
i was all of these .
well , you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently . no question about that .
what about oleg ?
disappeared . they're looking everywhere . maybe he went back to czechoslovakia .
no , he is here . shit .
don't worry about him . think about yourself .
what about my movie rights ? book rights ?
look , i haven't really focused on that kind of thing .
what's your cut ? how much ?
i would say . half . half is fair .
no . no way .
but it's .
thirty percent . no more . or i call another lawyer . this is the biggest case of your life . don't try to negotiate . thirty percent . say yes or no .
this is not about money , emil . i need your trust in me .
what else do you need ?
i need to know about your background . i need to know about your upbringing . why you're here .
give me another one , please .
tell me about yourself . what you did as a young boy . what your parents were like .
my father always degraded me . killed my self esteem . and my mother was blind .
your mother was blind ?
yeah , she went blind giving birth to me . she went to fucking black market doctor to induce me .
back in the czech republic ?
yeah , yeah . bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind . and my father blamed me for her blindness .
your father blamed you for your mother's blindness ?
yeah , he hated me from day when i was born . put it out . can you put the cigarette out ?
your father put cigarettes out on you ?
out on my back when i was a small boy .
can i see your back ?
i'm abused . don't you think ?
i don't think it's abuse , i think it's torture .
. so we kill someone famous and if we are caught , we are sent to mental hospital .
officers , there's your killer , do your duty , arrest him !
yes , your majesty .
you were right , don sanchez . his demands could never be granted .
never , your majesty . although .
yes . it would be a pity , wouldn't it ? call him back !
every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying . but with no gold ! the new world proves expensive , your majesty .
we weren't expecting immediate profits , were we ? we must have faith . we must give time for time .
. but there is worse . he ordered the execution of five members of the nobility .
is this true , brother buyl ?
he must be replaced .
and who would you think of , for such a task ?
then why ?
because he is not afraid of me .
where can i meet this man ?
immediately .
six days ago , yes .
you must be mad . !
we have to keep the hopes of these men alive !
we're on the verge of a mutiny , colon !
you think i don't know that ?
we're lost !
the land is there . i know it !
you don't know anything ! listen colon , these are my ships , right ? so i'm telling you we're turning back !
and then what ? half of the water has gone , the rest is nearly putrid ! you know that !
jesus maria ! i should have never listened to you !
you never did . you did all the talking for both of us , remember ?
you bloody .
pinzon , pinzon . all we can do now is go forward ! think about that !
you tell that to them !
you're right . let the men decide .
god be with us admiral .
and what do you think mendez ?
well , i surely know what a quadrant is ! but i've never seen it used at night before .
come over here .
twenty eight .
he's drawing an isthmus . he's saying we're on an isthmus .
we can't be .
and you say this is an indian vice ? by god ! i don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin .
the indians have no such word , don moxica .
we lost cousins , friends . we will wash this in blood .
if you want to keep your head on your shoulders , you'll do as i say .
we don't need to know .
we came here to stay ! to build ! not to start a crusade . in this forest , there is enough danger to sweep us away in days ! so we will be brave and swallow our grief . and in the name of those who died , we will accomplish what we came for .
my horse doesn't work .
don moxica we all have to work .
you did not hear me , don colon . not my horse .
in one act of brutality , you have created chaos . tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us ! all that because of your criminal savagery !
savagery is what monkeys understand .
you'll be held in detention , deprived of your privileges and possessions . until you are returned to spain where you will be judged . have you anything to say ?
you will regret this .
i should not even be listening to you , since my council said no . but santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity . and sanchez , that you are not a fool .
no more than the woman who said she would take granada from the moors .
the ocean is uncrossable ?
what did they say about granada before today ?
that she was impregnable .
surely you can do anything you want .
you show no inclination to speak otherwise !
i know what i see . i see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is . who's not afraid . i see a women who thinks . what if ? .
a woman ?
thirty seven , your majesty . and you ?
do they have such thoughts ?
they come and go as naked as the day god created them .
but without your brothers . nor are you to return to santo domingo or any of the other colonies . you may explore the continent .
thank you .
there is one thing i'd like to understand . why do you want to go back , after all this ?
your majesty some men are content to read about things . i must see them with my own eyes . i cannot be other than i am .
diego is a bright boy a pleasure to teach but so serious . brothers should be raised together , colon . even brothers from different mothers .
father , i am doing what i think is the best for him . and he has the teacher i would have chosen for myself .
that's what it says .
how did you manage it ?
with some difficulty . i had to promise them you were not a total fool .
to open a new route to asia . at the moment there are only two ways of reaching it .
how can you be so certain ? the ocean is said to be infinite .
ignorance ! i believe the indies are no more than leagues west of the canary islands .
how can you be so certain ?
the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr , esdras .
esdras is a jew .
so was christ !
two minutes . and already you're a dead man . don't let passion overwhelm you , colon .
i'll try to remember that , marchena .
father marchena !
passion is something one cannot control !
you get so carried away when you are being contradicted !
i've been contradicted all my life . eternity !
only god knows the meaning of such words , my son .
wait ! i've waited seven years already ! how much longer do you want me to wait ?
if god intends you to go , then you will go .
damn god !
colon !
damn all of you ! you all set up theories based on what ? you never leave the safety of your studies ! go out ! find out what the world is about and then tell me something i can listen to !
colon ! don't !
forgive me , father . for i have sinned .
i am listening , my son .
father , i have betrayed my family . i betrayed my men . and i betrayed you .
what are you saying ?
i lied . the journey will be longer than i said .
how long ?
i am not sure . it could be twice the distance .
may god forgive you . ! you must tell them ! you must tell your men !
if i tell them , they won't follow me . you know that i am right , father . you trust me .
my son , my son . your certitudes are sometimes frightening . christopher , you must speak to them . and if you don't i will .
you are bound by an oath , father .
i believed in you .
give me absolution .
i suppose we're both old men now .
you'll always be older than me , father .
i knew you would .
new worlds create new people .
oh ? so you are a new man ?
i don't know . i have the impression that i didn't change that much . i still can't accept the world as it is !
say not here ! cuba !
what is it ? a tribe ? an island ?
island . far .
tell the chief we thank him .
chief knows .
tell him his country is very beautiful . tell him we are leaving men here to build a fort .
chief says how many ?
thousands .
why ?
to bring the word of god .
chief says he has a god .
. and also to bring medicine .
chief says .
he has medicine . tell him we admire his people .
he understands .
ask him if he will help .
you did the same to your god !
utapan , won't you speak to me ? you used to know how to speak to me .
you never learned how to speak my language .
no .
no ?
no . ! i have waited too long , fought too hard . now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit ! no . i will not be your servant !
i remind you , senor colon , that you are in no position to bargain with me .
i'm not bargaining !
then you are too ambitious .
and were you never ambitious , excellency ? or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles , a fault for the rest of us ?
if you won't accept our proposal , we'll simply find someone who will .
they don't see sin in their nakedness . they live according to nature , in a never ending summer . the islands are covered with trees , filled with blossoms and fruits . and .
forgive me , don colon . but what about gold ?
. for a commoner ?
don bobadilla is already a judge , my dear don cristobal .
good ! we are also in need of judges . except there are no thieves !
you seem to have a special talent for making friends .
what . ? do i have so many already ?
to rise so high , in so short a time , is a dangerous occupation . a little hypocrisy goes a long way .
call them .
i am not afraid of you . you are nothing but a dreamer .
look out of that window .
roofs . towers , palaces . spires .
all of them created by people like me .
i want to go with you !
there'll be a time .
you promise ? do you swear on st . christopher . ?
yes . yes , i do . on all of them !
this time with me !
how are you feeling , fernando ?
not bad .
there must be a passage to that other ocean .
i am not listening , father . but i can't help hearing .
what does he say ?
he asks when he can come to visit you . he left his address .
he never had one . except aboard my ships !
i want you to tell me everything you remember , father . from the beginning . everything .
really ? god . i wouldn't know where to start . and yet .
tell me the first thing that comes to your mind .
i understand that you will soon be appointing governors for the islands ? is it not so ?
forgive me , don bobadilla those positions have already been taken .
may i ask by whom ?
bartolome and giacomo colon .
don alonso de bobadilla .
yes . i remember .
my letters of appointment .
appointment to what ?
viceroy of the west indies .
congratulations . then i am free to search for the mainland .
i am not a seaman . but i heard it is no more than a week at sea . i hope you are not too disappointed .
how could i be ? the mainland has been found . exactly as i said it would .
i am afraid this is not the worst news .
i could be gone for years .
i know .
i haven't given you much of a life .
well . that's true . i have a child by a man who won't marry me ! who's always leaving .
are we going to argue ?
i'd love to argue with you sometimes . but you're never here !
perhaps i was never meant to live with a woman .
i find that hard to believe .
she said yes .
thank god .
i don't want you to wait for me .
that's something you can't decide .
beatrix , i want to ask you something .
you don't usually ask .
i can arrange for the queen to take fernando and diego into her service .
they tried . but i didn't let them .
not everything . do you think i care ? i'm a free man again . riches don't make a man rich , they only make him busier .
i am busy inside .
i can't keep my eyes off you . i would like to catch up with all the moments i didn't spend with you .
the state has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition , your eminence .
the judgment is ours !
naturally . but i would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for spain for a . dispute over a point of geography .
he is a mercenary ! did he not already try to convince the king of portugal of his absurd notions ?
indeed . the world is full of mercenaries and states often make use of them , when it benefits them . my only concern is the welfare and prosperity of spain .
it won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now , don sanchez .
on the contrary , your eminence . it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross .
what a tragedy . what a waste of a life .
a waste . ? let me tell you something , arojaz . if your name , or mine , is ever remembered it will only be because of his .
you say asia can be found by sailing west ?
yes , your eminence . the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks .
unfortunately , don colon , that is precisely where our opinions differ . are you familiar with the work of aristotle ? erathostene ? ptolemeus ?
i am , your eminence
then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations , the circumference of the earth is approximately . , leagues or more . which makes the ocean . uncrossable .
excellency , you are right .
your life , and that of others !
if they agree to follow me , yes .
is that all that interests you ? gold ?
no . the portuguese have already discovered black skinned people . i , too , will find other populations and bring them to the word of god .
if god intended our proximity to asia , do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world ?
did he not choose a carpenter's son to reveal himself to the world ?
don't you realize your words could be considered heretical ?
blind faith is what i consider heresy !
if god wills it !
i never seen heat like this ! not even in las minas !
the water's going putrid in the barrels .
you'll be drinking your own piss . for the glory of spain . and admiral colon . ! bastard !
ah , leave him alone . he's doing no harm .
with a face like that ? i don't want you looking at me . you hear ?
we'll all go crazy .
we should have seen land .
we left three weeks ago , alonso . can't be that near .
can't be that far , i say . also , i don't like the smell of the sea around here . smells like a cunt . bad sign .
make anyone cry today ?
what's a synonym for throbbing ?
sarah lawrence is on the other side of the country .
tumescent !
you're not helping .
would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a british rear admiral ?
pirate no question .
they'll dance , they'll kiss , they'll come home . let her go .
kissing ? is that what you think happens ? kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day .
dr . ruth ?
but who what ?
your daughters went to the prom .
did i have anything to say about it ?
absolutely not .
that ' s what i thought
i missed you .
it says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls .
it was a bratwurst . i was eating lunch .
with the teeth of your zipper ?
touch of the flu .
i'm at a loss , then . what should we talk about ? your year of absence ?
what's to discuss ?
you weren't abused , you aren't stupid , and as far as i can tell , you're only slightly psychotic so why is it that you're such a fuck up ?
well , you know there's the prestige of the job title . and the benefits package is pretty good .
you're completely demented .
see you next week !
what ?
whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say .
the situation is , my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford .
what is it with this chick ? she have three tits ?
i think i speak correctly when i say that cameron's love is pure . purer than say joey dorsey's .
dorsey can plow whoever he wants . i'm just in this for the cash .
that's where we can help you . with kat .
so dorsey can get the girl ?
patrick , pat , you're not looking at the big picture . joey's just a pawn . we set this whole thing up so cameron can get the girl .
you two are gonna help me tame the wild beast ?
we're your guys .
what ? !
good enough .
are you telling me i'm a non smoker ?
just for now .
yeah .
i prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows .
i'm likin' you guys better
so you got cozy with she who stings ?
no i've got a sweet payin' job that i'm about to lose .
sweet love , renew thy force !
man don't say shit like that to me . people can hear you .
hey there . tired of breathing ?
hi .
cool pictures . you a fan ?
yeah . i guess .
oh yeah .
right .
kat a fan , too ?
yeah .
katarina stratford . my , my . you've been terrorizing ms . blaise again .
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action .
well , yes , compared to your other choices of expression this year , today's events are quite mild . by the way , bobby rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well , in case you're interested .
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls . i was merely a spectator .
the point is kat people perceive you as somewhat .
tempestuous ?
no . i believe heinous bitch is the term used most often .
am i supposed to feel better ? like , right now ? or do i have some time to think about it ?
just smack her now .
i know .
i thought we decided you were going to school here . at u of .
you decided .
enough !
then tell them i had a seizure .
is this about sarah lawrence ? you punishing me ?
i thought you were punishing me .
why can't we agree on this ?
because you're making decisions for me .
as a parent , that's my right
so what i want doesn't matter ?
you're eighteen . you don't know what you want . you won't know until you're forty five and you don't have it .
i want to go to an east coast school ! i want you to trust me to make my own choices . i want
was that your sister ?
yeah . she left with some bikers big ones . full of sperm .
funny .
no , daddy .
so tell me about this dance . was it fun ?
parts of it .
which parts ?
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy .
bianca did what ?
what's the matter ? upset that i rubbed off on her ?
no impressed .
when i go ?
oh , christ . don't tell me you've changed your mind . i already sent 'em a check .
i mean wo man . how ya doin' ?
sweating like a pig , actually . and yourself ?
there's a way to get a guy's attention .
my mission in life .
pick you up friday , then
oh , right . friday .
the night i take you to places you've never been before . and back .
like where ? the eleven on burnside ? do you even know my name , screwboy ?
i know a lot more than that
i don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion .
then say you'll spend dollar night at the track with me .
and why would i do that ?
come on the ponies , the flat beer , you with money in your eyes , me with my hand on your ass .
you covered in my vomit .
seven thirty ?
are you following me ?
i was in the laundromat . i saw your car . thought i'd say hi .
hi
you're not a big talker , are you ?
depends on the topic . my fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy .
hey . great show , huh ?
that's what you want , isn't it ?
do you mind ? you're sort of ruining it for me .
you know who the raincoats are ?
why , don't you ?
i'm getting trashed , man . isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party ?
i say , do what you wanna do .
funny , you're the only one
okay ?
i'm fine . i'm
you're not okay .
i just need to lie down for awhile
uh , uh . you lie down and you'll go to sleep
i know , just let me sleep
what if you have a concussion ? my dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable . not that i could tell the difference .
this is so patronizing .
leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced .
why 're you doing this ?
i told you
you don't care if i die
sure , i do
why ?
because then i'd have to start taking out girls who like me .
like you could find one
see that ? who needs affection when i've got blind hatred ?
just let me sit down .
why'd you let him get to you ?
who ?
dorsey .
i hate him .
i know . it'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila . you don't seem like the type .
hey man . . . you don ' t think i can be cool ? you don't think i can be laid back like everyone else ?
i thought you were above all that
you know what they say
kat ! wake up !
what ?
and i'm in control of it .
but it's gigglepuss i know you like them . i saw you there .
busy
were you in jail ?
maybe .
no , you weren't
then why'd you ask ?
why'd you lie ?
do what ?
this .
start a band ?
my father wouldn't approve of that that
you don't strike me as the type that would ask permission .
oh , so now you think you know me ?
i'm gettin' there
he just wants me to be someone i'm not .
who ?
bianca
no offense , but you're sister is without . i know everyone likes her and all , but .
what are you doing here ?
i heard there was a poetry reading .
you 're so
pleasant ?
unwelcome .
unwelcome ? i guess someone still has her panties in a twist .
don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties .
so what did i have an effect on ?
other than my upchuck reflex ? nothing .
look up , sunshine
c'mon . it's not that bad
try lookin' at it from this angle
put your right foot there
forget it . i'm stayin' .
you want me to climb up and show you how to get down ?
maybe .
the partridge family ?
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect . and piss you off .
good call .
so how'd you get chapin to look the other way ?
i dazzled him with my wit
a soft side ? who knew ?
yeah , well , don't let it get out
so what's your excuse ?
acting the way we do .
yes
i don't like to do what people expect . then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change .
so if you disappoint them from the start , you're covered ?
something like that
then you screwed up
how ?
you never disappointed me .
for . . . ?
fallacy .
the duck ?
hearsay .
i know the porn career's a lie .
i hate peas .
no something real . something no one else knows .
you're sweet . and sexy . and completely hot for me .
what ?
no one else knows
you're amazingly self assured . has anyone ever told you that ?
go to the prom with me
is that a request or a command ?
you know what i mean
no .
no what ?
no , i won't go with you
why not ?
because i don't want to . it's a stupid tradition .
so i have to have a motive to be with you ?
you tell me .
you need therapy . has anyone ever told you that ?
answer the question , patrick
nothing ! there's nothing in it for me . just the pleasure of your company .
how'd you get a tux at the last minute ?
it's scurvy's . his date got convicted . where'd you get the dress ?
it's just something i had . you know
oh huh
look , i'm sorry that i questioned your motives . i was wrong .
my grandmother's .
what ?
that's where i was last year . she'd never lived alone my grandfather died i stayed with her . i wasn't in jail , i don't know marilyn manson , and i've never slept with a spice girl . i spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching wheel of fortune . end of story .
that ' s completely adorable !
it gets worse you still have your freshman yearbook ?
you were paid to take me out ! by the one person i truly hate . i knew it was a set up !
it wasn't like that .
really ? what was it like ? a down payment now , then a bonus for sleeping with me ?
i didn't care about the money .
a fender strat . you bought this ?
i thought you could use it . when you start your band .
is that right ?
yeah , but then i fucked up . i fell for her .
why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill ?
because i like to torture you .
oh , bianca ? can you get me my freshman yearbook ?
don ' t you even dare . . .
who's that ?
patrick verona random skid .
that's pat verona ? the one who was gone for a year ? i heard he was doing porn movies .
i'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting .
he always look so
block e ?
just a little .
what's this ?
an attempted slit .
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking , but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions . you're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy .
but imagine the things he'd say during sex .
the people at this school are so incredibly foul .
you could always go with me . i'm sure william has some friends .
so he has this huge raging fit about sarah lawrence and insists that i go to his male dominated , puking frat boy , number one golf team school . i have no say at all .
william would never have gone to a state school .
william didn't even go to high school
that's never been proven
neither has his heterosexuality .
does it matter ?
if i was bianca , it would be , any school you want , precious . don't forget your tiara .
you think this'll work ?
no fear .
what'd he say ?
who cares ?
you went to the party ? i thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity .
i didn't have a choice .
you didn't have a choice ? where's kat and what have you done with her ?
i did bianca a favor and it backfired .
you didn't
i got drunk . i puked . i got rejected . it was big fun .
well , i guess we're not , since we don't have dates .
listen to you ! you sound like betty , all pissed off because archie is taking veronica .
okay , okay , we won't go . it's not like i have a dress anyway
you ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective . we're making a statement .
oh , good . something new and different for us .
who ?
william he asked me to meet him here .
oh , honey tell me we haven't' progressed to full on hallucinations .
hey .
are you lost ?
nope just came by to chat
we don't chat .
well , actually , i thought i'd run an idea by you . you know , just to see if you're interested .
we're not .
but she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her . right ?
does this conversation have a purpose ?
so what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her . someone who's up for the job .
i hear you're helpin' verona .
uh , yeah . we're old friend
you and verona ?
what ? we took bathes together when we were kids .
you better not fuck this up . i'm heavily invested .
hey it's all for the higher good right ?
yeah
what do you think ?
two legs , nice rack .
yeah , whatever . i want you to go out with her .
sure , sparky . i'll get right on it .
you just said
you need money to take a girl out
but you'd go out with her if you had the cake ?
you're gonna pay me to take out some girl ?
i can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend . and that's the catch . she doesn't want a boyfriend .
how much ?
fine , thirty .
fifty , and you've got your man .
when i shell out fifty , i expect results .
i'm on it
watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date .
i got her under control . she just acts crazed in public to keep up the image .
what ?
a hundred bucks a date .
forget it .
forget her sister , then .
a deal's a deal .
do what ?
get her to act like a human
i don't know , dorsey . . the limo . the flowers . another hundred for the tux
enough with the barbie n' ken shit . i know .
yeah , and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow . tough break .
they're running the rest of me next month .
hey do you mind ?
not at all
away .
your sister here ?
leave my sister alone .
and why would i do that ?
and he means that strictly in a non prison movie type of way .
yeah we'll see .
i've retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think you'll find helpful .
so what does that give me ? i'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments ?
gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night .
don't make me do it , man
it's off . the whole thing .
what 're you talking about ?
she's partial to joey , not me
cameron do you like the girl ?
sure
then , go get her
what'd you do to her ?
i don ' t know . i decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it .
she hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . that's a direct quote
she just needs time to cool off i'll give it a day .
she kissed me .
where ?
you get the girl .
you the new guy ?
so they tell me .
c'mon . i'm supposed to give you the tour .
north , actually . how'd you ?
i was kidding . people actually live there ?
yeah . a couple . we're outnumbered by the cows , though .
how many people were in your old school ?
thirty two .
get out !
how many people go here ?
couple thousand . most of them evil
that i'm used to .
yeah , but these guys have never seen a horse . they just jack off to clint eastwood .
that girl i
you burn , you pine , you perish ?
who is she ?
bianca stratford . sophomore . don't even think about it
why not ?
i could start with your haircut , but it doesn't matter . she's not allowed to date until her older sister does . and that's an impossibility .
why do girls like that always like guys like that ?
because they're bred to . their mothers liked guys like that , and their grandmothers before them . their gene pool is rarely diluted .
he always have that shit eating grin ?
joey dorsey ? perma shit grin . i wish i could say he's a moron , but he's number twelve in the class . and a model . mostly regional stuff , but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out .
sure do . my mom's from canada
guess who just signed up for a tutor ?
you mean i'd get a chance to talk to her ?
you could consecrate with her , my friend .
that's her ? bianca's sister ?
the mewling , rampalian wretch herself .
i teach her french , get to know her , dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me .
unlikely , but even so , she still can't go out with you . so what's the point ?
what about him ?
you wanna go out with him ?
he seems like he thrives on danger
no kidding . he's a criminal . i heard he lit a state trooper on fire . he just got out of alcatraz .
they always let felons sit in on honors biology ?
i'm serious , man , he's whacked . he sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers .
forget his reputation . do you think we've got a plan or not ?
did she actually say she'd go out with you ?
that's what i just said
you know , if you do go out with bianca , you'd be set . you'd outrank everyone . strictly a list . with me by your side .
i thought you hated those people .
hey i've gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street .
you got him involved ?
like we had a choice ? besides when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle , you're in a position of power . we let him pretend he's calling the shots , and while he's busy setting up the plan , you have time to woo bianca .
this is it . a golden opportunity . patrick can ask katarina to the party .
in that case , we'll need to make it a school wide blow out .
will bogey get bent ?
are you kidding ? he'll piss himself with joy . he's the ultimate kiss ass .
number one . she hates smokers
it's a lung cancer issue
her favorite uncle
dead at forty one .
okay ! i wasn't sure
assail your ears for one night .
it's her favorite band .
you told me that part already .
hell , i've just been going over the whole thing in my head and
extremely unfortunate maneuver .
the hell is that ? what kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her ?
buttholus extremus . but hey , you're making progress .
no , i ' m not .
best case scenario , you're back on the payroll for awhile .
always a pleasure , brucie .
didn't have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan . aren't they a little too pre teen belly button ring for you ?
fan of a fan . you see a couple of minors come in ?
never
padua girls . one tall , decent body . the other one kinda short and undersexed ?
just sent 'em through .
now don't get upset . daddy , but there's this boy . and i think he might ask .
no ! you're not dating until your sister starts dating . end of discussion .
what if she never starts dating ?
then neither will you . and i'll get to sleep at night .
but it's not fair she's a mutant , daddy !
exactly my point
daddy , i
and where're you going ?
if you must know , we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends .
otherwise known as an orgy ?
it's just a party . daddy , but i knew you'd forbid me to go since gloria steinem over there isn't going
if kat's not going , you're not going .
it's just a party . daddy .
wear the belly before you go .
daddy , no !
just for a minute
why ?
because she'll scare them away .
daddy , i want to discuss the prom with you . it's tomorrow night
the prom ? kat has a date ?
no , but
it's that hot rod joey , right ? that ' s who you want me to bend my rules for ?
he's not a hot rod . whatever that is .
you're not going unless your sister goes . end of story .
fine . i see that i'm a prisoner in my own house . i'm not a daughter . i'm a possession !
i'm missing something .
i have a date , daddy . and he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know .
where've you been ?
nowhere . hi , daddy .
i have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way .
can you at least start wearing a bra ?
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and we're going .
oh , i thought you might have a date i don't know why i'm bothering to ask , but are you going to bogey lowenstein's party saturday night ?
what do you think ?
i think you're a freak . i think you do this to torture me . and i think you suck .
what's normal ?
bogey lowenstein's party is normal , but you're too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that .
at least i'm not a clouted fen sucked hedge pig .
like i'm supposed to know what that even means .
it's shakespeare . maybe you've heard of him ?
yeah , he's your freak friend mandella's boyfriend . i guess since i'm not allowed to go out , i should obsess over a dead guy , too .
can we go now ?
i really don't think i need any social advice from you right now .
you're welcome .
like you care .
i do care . but i'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons , not someone else ' s .
i wish i had that luxury . i'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i can't go , because you won ' t .
joey never told you we went out , did he ?
what ?
in th . for a month
why ?
he was , like , a total babe
but you hate joey
now i do . back then , was a different story .
as in .
he said everyone was doing it . so i did it .
you did what ?
just once . afterwards , i told him i didn't want to anymore . i wasn't ready . he got pissed . then he broke up with me .
but
after that , i swore i'd never do anything just because everyone else was doing it . and i haven't since . except for bogey's party , and my stunning gastro intestinal display
why didn't you tell me ?
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him .
no . you didn't ! if you really thought i could make my own decisions , you would've let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage .
that's not
i'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes .
i guess i thought i was protecting you .
god , you're just like him ! just keep me locked away in the dark , so i can't experience anything for myself
not all experiences are good , bianca . you can't always trust the people you want to .
i guess i'll never know , will i ?
so did you
let go !
you set me up .
i just wanted
what ? to completely damage me ? to send me to therapy forever ? what ?
no ! i just wanted
it's just you .
patrick is that a .
perm ?
it's more
expensive ?
exactly so , you going to bogey lowenbrau's thing on saturday ?
hopefully .
so yeah , i've got the sears catalog thing going and the tube sock gig that's gonna be huge . and then i'm up for an ad for queen harry next week .
queen harry ?
it's a gay cruise line , but i'll be , like , wearing a uniform and stuff .
neat .
my agent says i've got a good shot at being the prada guy next year .
hi , joey .
you're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class .
you know the deal . i can ' t go if kat doesn't go
no .
you might wanna think about it
who ?
joey .
great
would you mind getting me a drink , cameron ?
is he oily or dry ?
combination . i don't know i thought he'd be different . more of a gentleman .
bianca , i don't think the highlights of dating joey dorsey are going to include door opening and coat holding .
sometimes i wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with , you know ?
all i know is i'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like joey .
i have to be home in twenty minutes .
i don't have to be home 'til two .
i did .
well , i thought we'd start with pronunciation , if that's okay with you .
not the hacking and gagging and spitting part . please .
okay . then how 'bout we try out some french cuisine . saturday ? night ?
you're asking me out . that's so cute . what's your name again ?
forget it .
no , no , it's my fault we didn't have a proper introduction
cameron .
the thing is , cameron i'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser . my sister . i can't date until she does .
seems like she could get a date easy enough .
unsolved mystery . she used to be really popular when she started high school , then it was just like she got sick of it or something .
that's a shame .
gosh , if only we could find kat a boyfriend .
let me see what i can do .
c'esc ma tete . this is my head
right . see ? you're ready for the quiz .
i don't want to know how to say that though . i want to know useful things . like where the good stores are . how much does champagne cost ? stuff like chat . i have never in my life had to point out my head to someone .
that's because it's such a nice one .
forget french .
well , there's someone i think might be
where ?
you got something on your mind ?
i counted on you to help my cause . you and that thug are obviously failing . aren't we ever going on our date ?
you have my word . as a gentleman
you're sweet .
how do you get your hair to look like that ?
eber's deep conditioner every two days . and i never , ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment .
sure have .
i really , really , really wanna go , but i can't . not unless my sister goes .
i'm workin' on it . but she doesn't seem to be goin' for him .
lesbian ? no . i found a picture of jared leto in one of her drawers , so i'm pretty sure she's not harboring same sex tendencies .
so that's the kind of guy she likes ? pretty ones ?
who knows ? all i've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes .
looks like things worked out tonight , huh ?
you know chastity ?
i believe we share an art instructor
tons
i looked for you back at the party , but you always seemed to be occupied .
i was ?
you never wanted to go out with 'me , did you ?
well , no .
then that's all you had to say .
but
you always been this selfish ?
then guillermo says , if you go any lighter , you're gonna look like an extra on .
no .
do you listen to this crap ?
what crap ?
me . this endless . blonde babble . i'm like , boring myself .
thank god ! if i had to hear one more story about your coiffure .
what good stuff ?
the real you .
like my fear of wearing pastels ?
no
okay you're gonna need to learn how to lie .
wow
let's go .
she okay ?
i hope so .
they do to !
they do not !
