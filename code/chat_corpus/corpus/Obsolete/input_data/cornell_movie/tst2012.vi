i'm not leaving you .
i am so ashamed .
what for ?
i was foolish . i thought you did not care for my work or me . forgive me . forgive me !
quiet ! quiet ! quiet ! down there , damn you . welcome to you . pay no attention , they're impossible . stop it , you willful things ! come this way . just ignore them . they're perfectly harmless , just willful . i treat them just like my own children .
and which one of them do you want me to teach ?
what ? ha ha ! that's funny i like it . which one , eh ? you're a funny fellow . hannah ! come this way .
madame .
this is herr mozart , my dear . the young man herr salieri recommended to teach our gertrude . where is she ?
i'm afraid i am .
of course , it's him . who do you think it is ?
good morning , fraulein schlumberg .
strudel , this is herr mozart . say good morning .
well , yes ! on the whole . i suppose . how long have you been playing , fraulein ?
it's a miracle , herr mozart !
well , i'm a good teacher . the next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs , please let me know . goodbye , fraulein , goodbye , madame ! goodbye , sir !
herr mozart . what a surprise . what can i do for you ?
is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music ?
well , your pupil is married and living in mannheim , young man .
really ? perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction ?
what is this , mozart ? what's the matter with you ?
well . since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services , could you favour me with a little money instead ?
what for ?
if a man cannot earn , he must borrow .
well , this is hardly the way to go about it .
no doubt , sir . but i am endowed with talent , and you with money . if i offer mine , you should offer yours .
i'm sorry . no .
please . i'll give it back , i promise . please , sir .
my answer is no , mozart .
sssh !
stanzi manzi banzi wanzi !
sssh ! stay here .
what did he say ? what did he say ?
papa , the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room .
sublime ! utterly sublime !
that kind of music should be punishable by death .
yes , well , it's all good fun .
i liked the horse .
isn't he marvelous ? he cost me a bundle , that horse , but he's worth it . i tell you , if you'd played don giovanni here it would have been a great success . i'm not joking . these people aren't fools . you could do something marvelous for them .
i'd like to try them someday . i'm not sure i'd be much good at it .
'course you would . you belong here , my boy , not the snobby court . you could do anything you felt like here the more fantastic the better ! that's what people want , you know fantasy . you do a big production , fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want . of course , you'd have to put a fire in it , because i've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood i can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life . oh , and a few trick animals . you'd have to use those .
animals ?
i tell you i picked up a snake in dresden last week twelve foot long folds up to six inches , just like a paper fan . it's a miracle .
german !
of course ! what else do you think they speak here ?
no , no , i love that . i'd want it to be in german . i haven't done anything in german since seraglio .
so there you are . what do you say ?
leave that alone !
wolfi !
put it down !
what is this ?
put it down , i said ! it's nothing for you .
oh ! i'm sorry ! i'm sorry ! what have you got for me ? is it finished ?
what ?
what ? the vaudeville , what'd you think ?
yes .
can i see it ?
no .
why not ?
because there's nothing to see .
look , i asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes .
well , we can .
so let me see it . where is it ?
yes ?
are you herr mozart ?
that's right .
my name is lorl , sir . i'm a maidservant . i was asked to come here and offer my services to you .
what ?
they'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon anonymous .
are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is ?
yes . i can live in or out just as you wish .
ah ! here she comes . fraulein lorl , good morning .
good morning , sir .
what have you got for me today ? let me see .
i will , sir .
thank you . are you well today , fraulein lorl ?
yes , thank you , sir .
bene ! bene !
madame cavalieri is here for her lesson , sir .
bene .
oh , thank you , sir .
do any pupils come to the house ?
not that i've seen .
then how does he pay for all this ? does he work at all ?
oh , yes , sir , all day long . he never leaves the house until evening . he just sits there , writing and writing . he doesn't even eat .
really ? what is it he's writing ?
oh , i wouldn't know that , sir .
of course not . you're a good girl . you're very kind to do this . next time you're sure they'll be out of the house , let me know , will you ?
i think i've found out about the money , sir .
yes what ?
in there , sir .
now calm yourself . calm . what's the matter with you ?
i'm leaving . i'm not working there anymore . i'm scared !
why ? what has happened ?
you don't know what it's like . herr mozart frightens me . he drinks all day , then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse .
what medicine ?
i don't know . he has pains .
where ?
here , in his stomach . they bend him right over .
is he working ?
i'm frightened , sir . really ! when he speaks , he doesn't make any sense . you know he said he saw he said he saw his father . and his father's dead .
is he working ?
i suppose so . he sits there all he time , doing some silly opera .
opera ? opera !
please don't ask me to go back again . i'm frightened ! i'm very , very frightened .
are you sure it's an opera ?
i write to you with urgent news . i am coming to vienna . take no further steps toward marriage until we meet . you are too gullible to see your own danger . as you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours , do as i bid , and await my coming .
i will .
am i not welcome ?
of course , welcome ! welcome ten thousand times . papa ! my papa !
is she not here ?
i don't know . stanzi ? stanzi !
do you always live like this ?
oh , yes . oh , i mean no not exactly like this . i mean today just today , stanzi i remember now . she had to go yes ! she had to help her mother . yes , she's like that . her mother's a very sweet woman , you'll see .
don't you have a maid ?
oh we could , if we wanted to , but stanzi won't hear of it . she wants to do everything herself .
how is your financial situation ?
it couldn't be better .
that's not what i hear .
what do you mean ? it's wonderful . really , it's it's marvelous ! people love me here .
they say you're in debt .
who ? who says that ? now that's a malicious lie !
how many pupils do you have ?
pupils ?
yes .
yes .
how many ?
i don't know . it's not important . i mean , i don't want pupils . they get in the way . i've got to have time for composition .
composition doesn't pay . you know that .
this one will .
what's that ?
oh , let's not talk about it .
why not ?
it's a secret .
you don't have secrets from me .
it's too dangerous , papa . but they're going to love it . ah , there she is !
why didn't you mention it in your letters ?
didn't i ? i thought i did . i'm sure i did .
thank you . that'll be fine . don't spend any money on me .
why not ? oh , come , papa ! what better way could i spend it than on you ? my kissable , missable , suddenly visible papa !
no , really !
this is just a game , papa .
i want you to come back with me to salzburg , my son .
but my penalty . i've got to have a penalty .
mine ?
are you playing a trick on me ?
i never saw this girl in my life . is this a kind of joke ?
papa !
don't worry , i'm not staying here to be a burden .
no one calls you that .
she does . she says i sleep all day .
father
hush ! i'm talking to his majesty . your majesty , i wish to express only one thing that you who are the father of us all , could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers . it is not for nothing that the fifth commandment tells us 'honour your father and mother , that your days may be long upon the earth . '
ah ha . well then , we should make some effort to acquire him . we could use a good german composer in vienna , surely ?
i agree , majesty , but i'm afraid it's not possible . the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop .
very small pay , i imagine . i'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer . say , an opera in german for our national theatre .
in my opinion , it is time we had a piece in our own language , sir . plain german . for plain people .
well . there it is .
your majesty , herr mozart
yes , what about him ?
he's here .
ah ha . well . there it is . good .
your majesty !
no , no , please ! it is not a holy relic . you know we have met already ? in this very room . perhaps you won't remember it , you were only six years old . he was giving the most brilliant little concert here . as he got off the stool , he slipped and fell . my sister antoinette helped him up herself , and do you know what he did ? jumped straight into her arms and said , will you marry me , yes or no ?
oh , thank you .
the director of our opera . count orsini rosenberg .
oh sir , yes ! the honour is mine . absolutely .
and now he has returned the compliment . herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you .
really ? oh , grazie , signore ! sono commosso ! e un onore per mo eccezionale . compositore brilliante e famossissimo !
did we vote in the end for german or italian ?
because i've already found the most wonderful libretto !
well , what is it about ? tell us the story .
it's actually quite amusing , majesty . it's set the whole thing is set in a in a
yes , where ?
in a pasha's harem , majesty . a seraglio .
ah ha .
keep it , sire , if you want to . it is already here in my head .
what ? on one hearing only ?
i think so , sire , yes .
yes , indeed .
and german ?
oh , yes . absolutely . german . unquestionably !
so then you like it ? you really like it , your majesty ?
of course i do . it's very good . of course now and then just now and then it gets a touch elaborate .
what do you mean , sire ?
well , i mean occasionally it seems to have , how shall one say ? how shall one say , director ?
i don't understand . there are just as many notes , majesty , as are required . neither more nor less .
my dear fellow , there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening . i think i'm right in saying that , aren't i , court composer ?
which few did you have in mind , majesty ?
enchanted , madame .
well well we haven't quite received my father's consent , your majesty . not entirely . not altogether .
excuse me , but how old are you ?
twenty six .
well , my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in vienna .
thank you , sire !
what is it ?
may i introduce my father ? he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to salzburg . he would so much like to kiss your hand . it would make his whole stay so memorable for him .
ah ! by all means .
yes , sire .
yet we hear you are making an opera from it . is this true ?
who told you this , majesty ?
it is not your place to ask questions . is it true ?
well , yes , i admit it is .
would you tell me why ?
well , majesty , it is only a comedy .
mozart , i am a tolerant man . i do not censor things lightly . when i do , i have good reason . figaro is a bad play . it stirs up hatred between the classes . in france it has caused nothing but bitterness . my own dear sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people . i do not wish to see the same fears starting here .
sire , i swear to your majesty , there's nothing like that in the story . i have taken out everything that could give offense . i hate politics .
i think you are rather innocent , my friend . in these dangerous times i cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece .
but , majesty , this is just a frolic . it's a piece about love .
ah , love again .
but it's new , it's entirely new . it's so new , people will go mad for it . for example , i have a scene in the second act it starts as a duet , just a man and wife quarreling . suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly a very funny situation . duet turns into trio . then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in . trio turns into quartet . then a stupid old gardener quartet becomes quintet , and so on . on and on , sextet , septet , octet ! how long do you think i can sustain that ?
i have no idea .
guess ! guess , majesty . imagine the longest time such a thing could last , then double it .
well , six or seven minutes ! maybe eight !
twenty , sire ! how about twenty ? twenty minutes of continuous music . no recitatives .
you are passionate , mozart ! but you do not persuade .
sire , the whole opera is finished . do you know how much work went into it ?
i think it is an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna , majesty . it should really infuriate the archbishop beyond measure if that is your majesty's intention .
you are cattivo , court composer . i want to meet this young man . chamberlain , arrange a pleasant welcome for him .
it's just a trifle , of course .
may i try it ?
majesty .
delightful , court composer . would you permit me to play it as he comes in ?
you do me too much honour , sire .
let's have some fun . bring in herr mozart , please . but slowly , slowly . i need a minute to practice .
a flat , majesty .
ah ha !
finally ! such an immense joy . diletto straordinario !
well , there it is . now to business . young man , we are going to commission an opera from you . what do you say ?
excuse me , sire , but what do you think these could be ? being a foreigner , i would love to learn .
cattivo again , court composer . well , tell him , mozart . name us a german virtue .
your highness .
i'm thinking about herr mozart . what is your view ?
an interesting idea , majesty . but
yes ?
you already commissioned an opera from mozart .
and the result satisfies .
yes , of course . my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism .
ah ha . favouritism . but i so want mozart .
i'm sure there is a way , majesty . some kind of a little contest . i could perhaps put together a small committee , and i could see to it naturally that it will select according to your majesty's wishes .
you please me , court composer . a very clever idea .
sire .
well . there it is .
majesty , i did . believe me , it was a most agonizing . decision . but finally , i simply could not recommend herr mozart .
why not ?
well , sire , i made some inquiries in a routine way . i was curious to know why he had so few pupils . it is rather alarming .
oh ?
majesty , i don't like to talk against a fellow musician .
of course not .
i have to tell you , mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies .
really ?
as a matter of fact , one of my own pupils a very young singer told me she was er well !
yes ?
molested , majesty . twice , in the course of the same lesson .
do you like this , salieri ?
it is not a question of liking , your majesty . your own law decrees it , i'm afraid .
well , look at them .
really ?
ah , now ! here she comes .
i'd like a little wine , if you have it .
wine ?
who was your teacher ?
i was . but she quite outgrew the little i could show her .
thank you , madame . come on now courage . play me something you know .
upstairs .
gertrude !
you can't be herr mozart !
gertrude !
it's such an honour for us to have you here , herr mozart . and for gertrude .
people who know say the girl's got talent . you must judge for yourself . if you think she stinks , say so .
michael , please ! i'm sure you will find her most willing , herr mozart . she's really very excited . she's been preparing all morning .
i said play !
michael !
yes . he is a little strange .
let us pass , please ! let us pass at once ! we're with the emperor .
i am sorry , madame . it is not permitted .
do you know who i am ? this is my daughter . i am frau weber . we are favoured guests !
i am sorry , madame , but i have my orders .
call herr mozart ! you call herr mozart immediately ! this is insupportable !
i am sorry , madame , but no ! i cannot let anyone pass .
young man , i am no stranger to theatres . i'm no stranger to insolence !
be careful !
be careful !
he's adorable !
adorable !
behold !
behold !
hey !
hey !
behold !
behold !
i see that you're expecting .
oh , yes .
when , may i ask ?
in three months ! papa .
but you can't take her without reference . it's unheard of !
well , this is none of your business . whoever sent you is going to pay , no ?
and what do you expect ? who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day ?
oh , now i'm a bad housekeeper !
so you are ! the place is a pigsty all the time .
do you hear him ? do you ?
ah . well . ah , i see you've got your manager with you . well , madame , how about half the receipts ?
not at all .
where's our friend ?
he's not in . but he's working on it . he said to tell you .
i hope so . i need it immediately .
leave him alone !
i'm paying these people . do you realize that ?
he's doing his best .
i'm paying people just to wait for you . it's ridiculous !
you know what's ridiculous ? your libretto , that's what's ridiculous . only an idiot would ask wolfi to work on that stuff !
oh yes ? and what's so intelligent about writing a requiem ?
money ! money !
you're mad ! she's mad , wolfi .
oh yes , and who are you ? he's worked for kings . for the emperor . who are you ?
madame . how can i help you ?
that's right , your excellency . i've come on behalf of my hus band . i'm i'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment .
how charming . but why did he not come himself ?
he's terribly busy , sir .
i understand .
would it be too much trouble , sir , to ask you to look at them now ? while i wait .
i'm afraid i'm not at leisure this very moment . just leave them with me . i assure you they will be quite safe .
i i really cannot do that , your excellency . you see , he doesn't know i'm here .
really ?
my husband is a proud man , sir . he would be furious if he knew i'd come .
then he didn't send you ?
no , sir . this is my own idea .
i see .
sir , we really need this job . we're desperate . my husband spends far more than he can ever earn . i don't mean he's lazy he's not at all he works all day long . it's just ! he's not practical . money simply slips through his fingers , it's really ridiculous , your excellency . i know you help musicians . you're famous for it . give him just this one post . we'd be forever indebted !
don't keep calling me that . it puts me at such a distance . i was not born a court composer , you know . i'm from a small town , just like your husband .
that's very tempting , but it's impossible , i'm afraid . wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing . you see , they're all originals .
originals ?
yes .
these are originals ?
yes , sir . he doesn't make copies .
it is miraculous .
oh yes . he's really proud of his work .
tomorrow night i dine with the emperor . one word from me and the post is his .
oh , thank you , sir !
come back tonight .
tonight ?
alone .
what for ?
some service deserves service in return . no ?
what do you mean ?
isn't it obvious ?
but ! i'm a married woman !
then don't . it's up to you . not to be vague , that is the price .
i do apologize for this afternoon . i behaved like a silly girl . where shall we go ?
what ?
should we stay here ? it's a charming room . i love these candlesticks . were they here earlier ? i didn't notice them i suppose i was too nervous .
your husband is ill , ma'am . he took sick . i brought him home .
why you ?
i was at hand .
well , thank you very much . you can go now .
he needs me , ma'am .
no , he doesn't . and i don't want you here . just go , please .
he asked me to stay .
and i'm asking you
no . i was assisting him . he asked me .
he's not going to work on this anymore . it is making him ill . please .
madame , i will respect his . he asked me to stay here .
stop it !
i am ! i am ! i'm stopping it slowly . you see ! look , i've stopped . now we are going back .
no ! no ! no !
yes ! back ! back ! listen don't you know where you are ?
where ?
we are in the residence of the fartsbishop of salzburg .
fartsbishop !
go ahead , tell him . tell them all . they won't understand you anyway .
why not ?
because here everything goes backwards . people walk backwards , dance backwards , sing backwards , and talk backwards .
that's stupid .
why ? people fart backwards .
do you think that's funny ?
yes , i think it's brilliant . you've been doing it for years .
oh , ha , ha , ha .
sra i'm sick ! sra i'm sick !
yes , you are . you're very sick .
no , no . say it backwards , shit wit . sra i'm sick say it backwards !
sra i'm sick . sick kiss i'm my kiss my ! sra i'm sick kiss my arse !
em iram ! em iram !
no , i'm not playing this game .
no , this is serious . say it backwards .
no !
just say it you'll see . it's very serious . em iram ! em iram !
iram marry em marry me ! no , no ! you're a fiend . i'm not going to marry a fiend . a dirty fiend at that .
ui vol i tub !
tub but i tub but i vol love but i love ui you . i love you !
tish i'm tee . what's that ?
what ?
tish i'm tee .

yes .
eat my ah !
of course .
i think you're mad ! you're really mad !
oh , leave me alone .
one royal pupil and the whole of vienna will come flocking . we'd be set up for life !
they'll come anyway . they love me here .
no , they will not . i know how things work in this city .
oh yes ? you always know everything .
well , i'm not borrowing any more money from my mother , and that's that !
you borrowed money from your mother ?
yes !
well , don't do that again !
how are we going to live , wolfi ? do you want me to go into the streets and beg ?
don't be stupid .
all they want to see is your work . what's wrong with that ?
shut up ! just shut up ! i don't need them .
this isn't pride . it's sheer stupidity !
stop it now . stop it . i've brought some friends to meet you . they're next door waiting . do we have anything to eat ? they're all starving .
tell them to go away . i don't want to see anybody .
what's the matter with you ?
tell them to go !
sssh . what is it ? tell me .
no !
yes !
i love you ! i love you !
my stanzi look at her ! isn't she beautiful ? come on now , confess , papa . could you want a prettier girl for a daughter ?
stop it , wolfi . i look dreadful . welcome to our house , herr mozart .
he's not herr mozart . call him papa .
may i offer you some tea , herr mozart ?
tea ? who wants tea ? let's go out ! this calls for a feast . you don't want tea , papa . let's go dancing . papa loves parties , don't you ?
wolfi !
what ? how can you be so boring ? tea !
wolfi , i think your father's tired . i'll cook us something here .
what does she want ?
i don't know .
well , ask her !
she won't talk to me . she says she has to speak to you .
oh , damn !
look , old man , you stay out of this . we spend a fortune on you , more than we can possibly afford , and all you do is criticize , morning to night . and then you think you can
stanzi !
no , it's right he should hear . i'm sick to death of it . we can't do anything right for you , can we ?
we'll have a little party . come in . come in . you know herr schikaneder ? this is ! a very nice girl .
wolfi .
yes , my love ?
these gentlemen are from salzburg .
salzburg . we were just talking about salzburg . if you've come from my friend the fartsbishop , you've arrived at just the right moment . because i've got good news for him . i'm done with vienna . it's over , finished , done with ! done with ! done with !
wolfi ! your father is dead .
what ?
your father is dead .
half the receipts ! stanzi !
i'm talking about now . how much will you give him now ? down payment ?
why not ? half the house !
when ? we need money now . either he pays now , or you don't do it .
oh , stanzi .
i don't trust this man . and i didn't like what he did with your opera . it was common .
well , you liked it , didn't you ? monkey flunki punki .
half the house ! you'll never see a penny . i want it here , in my hand .
stanzi manzi , i'll put it in your hand !
shut up ! i'll not let you put anything in my hand until i see some money .
no one .
i heard voices .
i'm not telling you .
why not ?
you'd think i was mad .
why ?
this is my wife , stanzi . i've been sick , but i'm all right now . aren't i ?
oh yes , sir . he's all right . and he's working on it very hard .
give me two more weeks . please .
give me one reason i can understand .
i can't write it !
why not ?
it's killing me .
please ! let me sit here . let me stay here with you . i promise i won't say all word . i'll just be here , so you know no one's going to hurt you . please , please !
what is it ?
i want to go !
where ?
i want to go back to vienna .
now ?
yes !
why ?
i feel wrong . i feel wrong being here .
what are you talking about ?
don giovannnnnnnni !
who the devil are you ? what do you want ?
i've come to dinnnnnner !
dinner ? how dare you ? i am a nobleman . i only dine with people of my own height .
are you drunk ? you invited me . and my horse . here he is . ottavio !
in the pot , i have got a good dinner . not a sausage or stew , but a singer . not a sausage or stew but a singer . is the treat that i'll eat for my meat !
oh shut up . i'm sick to death of that tune .
why what , sir ?
why do i have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants ?
humiliated ?
how much provocation am i to endure from you ? the more license i allow you , the more you take .
if his grace is not satisfied with me , he can dismiss me .
i wish you to return immediately to salzburg . your father is waiting for you there patiently . i will speak to you further when i come .
no , your grace ! i mean with all humility , no . i would rather you dismissed me . it's obvious i don't satisfy .
then try harder , mozart . i have no intention of dismissing you . you will remain in my service and learn your place . go now .
but he needs to be here in salzburg , your grace . he needs me and he needs you . your protection , your understanding .
hardly .
oh sir , yes ! he's about to make the worst mistake of his life . some little viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage . i know my son . he is too simple to see the trap and there is no one there who really cares for him .
i'm not surprised . money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship . he has sold himself to vienna . let vienna look out for him .
sir
your son is an unprincipled , spoiled , conceited brat .
yes , sir , that's the truth . but don't blame him . the fault is mine . i was too indulgent with him . but not again . never again , i promise ! i implore you let me bring him back here . i'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully .
and how will you make him keep it ?
oh , sir , he's never disobeyed me in anything . please , your grace , give him one more chance .
you have leave to try .
oh , your grace i thank your grace ! i thank you !
katherina ! i'll tell you what i'm going to do . i'm going to write another aria for you . something even more amazing for the second act . i have to get some water . her mother is lying on the stage .
don't bother !
what ?
don't bother .
i'll be right back .
is her mother still lying on the floor ?
no , she's fine .
i'm so relieved .
what ?
i assume she's the virtuoso in that department . there can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that .
excuse us , fraulein . good night , signore .
maestro .
good morning .
well ? how do you like it ? it's turkish . my hairdresser tells me everything's going to be turkish this year !
really ? what else did he tell you today ? give me some gossip .
well , i heard you met herr mozart .
oh ? news travels fast in vienna .
and he's been commissioned to write an opera . is it true ?
yes .
is there a part for me ?
no .
how do you know ?
well even if there is , i don't think you want to get involved with this one .
why not ?
well , do you know where it's set , my dear ?
where ?
in a harem .
what's that ?
a brothel .
oh !
a turkish brothel .
turkish ? oh , if it's turkish , that's different . i want to be in it .
my dear , it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout vienna as a singing prostitute for a turk .
oh . well perhaps you could introduce us anyway .
perhaps .
what does he look like ?
you might be disappointed .
why ?
looks and talent don't always go together , katherina .
looks don't concern me , maestro . only talent interests a woman of taste .
what ?
the marriage !
well , what does it matter to you ?
nothing ! he can marry who he pleases . i don't give a damn .
you were sublime .
what did you think of the music ?
extremely clever .
meaning you didn't like it .
follow me , please . the archbishop would like a word .
certainly !
indeed .
these viennese certainly know good music when they hear it .
his grace is very angry with you .
what do you mean ?
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno's wish . a willing , billing , lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish . be my most tasty little dish ! be my most tasty little dish !
then that would be eating and drinking i'd live like a prince without thinking . the wisdom of old would be mine a woman's much better than wine ! then that would be eating and drinking ! the wisdom of old would be mine a woman's much better than wine . she's much better than wine ! she's much better than wine !
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno's wish . a willing , billing , lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish .
i need to net one birdie only and i will stop feeling so lonely . but if she won't fly to my aid , then into a ghost i must fade . i need to net one birdie only but if she won't fly to my aid , then into a ghost i must fade . to a ghost i must fade ! to a ghost i must fade !
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno's wish . a willing , billing , lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish .
at present the girls only peck me . their cruelty surely will wreck me . but one little beak in my own , and i'll up to heaven be flown ! at present the girls only peck me . but one little beak in my own , and i'll up to heaven be flown . up to heaven be flown ! up to heaven be flown !
it did not , however , contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up .
that's because i blew it out the goddamn airlock ! like i said .
thank you , officer ripley . that will be .
. because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew , within twelve hours of hatching .
because i don't have to . the people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship . and by the way , they call it acheron now .
what are you talking about . what people ?
sixty , maybe seventy families .
sweet jesus .
newt . my n name's newt . nobody calls me rebecca except my dork brother .
what about me ?
i don't want you for a friend .
why not ?
because you'll be gone soon , like the others . like everybody . you'll be dead and you'll leave me alone .
they'd be here if they could , honey . i know they would .
they're dead .
newt . look at me . newt . i won't leave you . i promise .
you promise ?
cross my heart .
and hope to die ?
the 'maze' ? you mean the air ducts ?
yeah , you know . in the walls , under the floor . i was the ace . i could hide better than anybody .
you're really something , ace .
i guess we're not leaving , right ?
i'm sorry , newt .
you don't have to be sorry . it wasn't your fault .
now you just lie here and have a nap . you're exhausted .
i don't want to . i have scary dreams .
oh . sorry , newt .
my mommy always said there were no monsters . no real ones . but there are .
yes , there are , aren't there .
why do they tell little kids that ?
well , some kids can't handle it like you can .
did one of those things grow inside her ?
i don't know , newt . that's the truth .
isn't that how babies come ? i mean people babies . they grow inside you ?
no , it's different , honey .
did you ever have a baby ?
yes . a little girl .
where is she ?
gone .
you mean dead .
i'll be right in the other room , newt . and look . i can see you on that camera right up there .
wah . ? where are . ?
sssh . don't move . we're in trouble .
mommy . i mean , ripley . i'm scared .
i know , honey . me too .
look !
do you know how to get to the landing field from here ?
sure . go left .
newt , wait !
i knew you'd come .
newt , i want you to hang on , now . hang on tight .
mommy . mommy ?
right here , baby . right here .
are we going to sleep now ?
that's right .
can we dream ?
yes , honey . i think we both can .
and how are we today ?
terrible .
just terrible ? that's better than yesterday at least .
how long have i been on gateway station ?
just a couple of days . do you feel up to a visitor ?
no . i've slept enough .
you remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau , out past the ilium range , a couple days ago ?
yeah . what ?
there's a guy on the horn , mom and pop survey team . says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored .
christ . some honch in a cushy office on earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere , we look . they don't say why , and i don't ask . i don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask . '
so what do i tell this guy ?
tell him , as far as i'm concerned , he finds something it's his .
sounds like you , hicks .
the embryo , the second form , hosts in the victim's body for several hours . gestating . then it . . then it . emerges . moults . grows rapidly
hey . hey ! look , crowe and dietrich aren't dead , man .
you can't help them . right now they're being cocooned just like the others .
oh , god . jesus . this ain't happening .
she survived longer than that with no weapons and no training .
yeah , right , it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here .
thanks .
uh , what's next ?
we need the other drop ship . the on one the sulaco . we have to bring it down on remote , somehow .
how ? the transmitter was on the apc . it's wasted .
i don't care how ! think of a way . think of something .
think of what ? we're fucked .
what about the colony transmitter ? that up link tower down at the other end . why can't we use that ?
oh , right ! right ! with those things running around . no way .
they cut the power .
what do you mean , they cut the power ? how could they cut the power , man ? they're animals .
just get back here !
range twenty meters .
seal the door .
fifteen meters .
i don't know , an acid hole in a duct . something under the floors , not on the plans . i don't know !
twelve meters . man , this is a big fucking signal . ten meters .
they're right on us . vasquez , how you doing ?
nine meters . eight .
can't be . that's inside the room !
it's readin' right . look !
no . have you ?
somebody said alien . she thought they said illegal alien and signed up .
fuck you .
anytime . anywhere .
all right , we can't blow the fuck out of them . why not roll some canisters of cn down there . nerve gas the whole nest ?
look , man , let's just bug out and call it even , okay ?
yeah , bullshit . watch us .
maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events , but we just got out asses kicked , pal !
hudson , give us a break .
it's inside the complex .
you're just reading me .
no . no ! it ain't you . they're inside . inside the perimeter . they're in here .
removed surgically before embryo implantation . subject marachuk , john l . died during procedure . they killed him getting it off .
poor bastard .
how long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue ?
about seventeen days .
all right . there's a fire door at this end . the first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door .
we gotta figure on them getting into the complex .
that's right . so we put up welded barricades at these intersections . . and seal these ducts here and here . then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units , here .
they're in the approach corridor .
on my way .
can't tell . lots . d gun's down to twenty . ten . it's out .
but they don't know that . they're probably looking for other ways to get in . that'll take them awhile .
maybe . maybe not .
hicks , i'm not going to wind up like those others . you'll take care of it won't you , it if comes to that ?
if it comes to that , i'll do us both . let's see that it doesn't here , i'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine .
what's this ?
well , that's the grenade launcher . you probably don't want to mess with that .
look , you started this . now show me everything . i can handle myself .
yeah . i've noticed .
the only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back . then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked .
let's waste him . no offense .
get back here , both of you . fall back to operations .
we didn't miss anything .
locked .
stand back .
no ! no ! she's alive ! we have to
all right ! she's alive . i believe it . but we gotta get moving ! now !
hicks , don't let him leave .
we ain't going anywhere .
ellen .
don't be long , ellen .
sure , hicks .
not that tunnel , the other one !
well that's great ! that's just fucking great , man . now what the fuck are we supposed to do , man ? we're in some real pretty shit now !
are you finished ? you okay ?
aye firmative .
we got problems .
i don't fucking believe this . do you believe this ?
i want you two walking the perimeter . i know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert . we've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand .
do it !
let's get these things lit .
six meters . five . what the fu
fuckin' a !
at ease . i'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left gateway but .
sir ?
yes , hicks ?
hudson , sir . he's hicks .
what's the question ?
is this going to be a stand up fight , sir , on another bug hunt ?
all we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved .
how do i get out of this chicken shit outfit ?
all right , the area's secured . let's go in and see what their computer can tell us . first team head for operations . hudson , see if you can get their cpu on line . hicks , meet me at the south lock by the up link tower .
he's coming in . i feel safer already .
okay , stand by in operations . let's go .
hah ! stop your grinnin' and drop your linen ! found 'em .
alive ?
unknown . but , it looks like all of them . over at the processing station . sublevel 'c' under the south tower .
we're not making that out too well . what is it ?
you tell me . i only work here .
how may drops is this for you , lieutenant ?
thirty eight . simulated .
the structure seems intact . they have power .
apone . where are your people ? anybody in d block ?
gorman ! give it a rest would you .
what is it ?
i don't know .
proceed inside .
so . then the fusion containment shuts down .
so ? so ?
get them out of there ! do it now !
shut up . just shut up !
they're but off ! do something !
all right , i guess . one hell of a hangover . look , ripley . i .
forget it .
look , we don't know what's going on out there . it may just be a down transmitter . but if it's not , i want you there . as an advisor . that's all .
you wouldn't be going in with the troops . i can guarantee your safety .
these colonial marines are some tough hombres , and they're packing state of the art firepower . nothing they can't handle . right , lieutenant ?
we're trained to deal with these kinds of situations .
still nothing from the colony ?
dead on all channels .
it's insured .
pdt's . personal data transmitters . every adult colonist had one surgically implanted .
we're talking thermonuclear explosion .
shit . apone , collect magazines from everybody . we can't have any firing in there .
fifty seven . oh , christ .
you'd drifted right through the core systems . it's blind luck that deep salvage team caught you when they . are you all right ?
have they located my daughter yet ?
well , i was going to wait until after the inquest .
is she . ?
amanda ripley mcclaren . married name , i guess . age sixty six . at time of death . two years ago . i'm sorry .
amy .
cancer . hmmmm . they still haven't licked that one . cremated . interred parkside repository , little chute , wisconsin . no children .
you read my deposition . it's complete and accurate .
look , i believe you , but there are going to be some heavyweights in there . you got feds , you got interstellar commerce commission , you got colonial administration , insurance company guys .
i get the picture .
just tell them what happened . the important thing is to stay cool and unemotional .
they had their minds made up before i even went in there . they think i'm a head case .
you are a head case . have a donut .
no . there's no way !
hear me out .
i was reamed , steamed and dry cleaned by you guys . and now you want me to go back out there ? forget it .
well , the corporation co financed that colony with the colonial administration , against mineral rights . we're getting into a lot of terraforming . 'building better worlds . '
yeah , yeah . i saw the commercial .
i heard you were working in the cargo docks .
that's right .
running loaders , forklifts , that sort of thing ?
it's all i could get . anyway , it keeps my mind off of . everything . days off are worse .
what if i said i could get you reinstated as a flight officer ? and that the company has agreed to pick up your contract ?
if i go .
if you go . it's a second chance , kiddo . and it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it . you gotta get back on the horse .
spare me , burke . i've had my psych evaluation this month .
yes , and i've read it . you wake up every night , sheets soaking , the same nightmare over and over .
no ! the answer is no . now please go . i'm sorry . just go , would you .
yello ? oh , ripley . hi .
burke , just tell me one thing . that you're going out there to kill them . not study . not bring back . just burn them out . clean . forever .
that's the plan . my word on it .
you never said anything about an android being here ! why not ?
well , it didn't occur to me . it's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board .
i hope you're right . i really do .
i suggest you study the disks ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you .
that the atmosphere processor ?
uh hunh . one of thirty or so , all over the planet . they're completely automated . we manufacture them , by the way .
they're right under the primary heat exchangers .
yeah ? maybe the organisms like the heat , that's why they built .
that's not what i mean . gorman , if your men have to use their weapons in there , they'll rupture the cooling system .
she's right .
no good . how do we know it'll effect their biochemistry ? i say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit . it's the only way to be sure .
now hold on a second . i'm not authorizing that action .
why not ?
well , i mean . i know this is an emotional moment , but let's not make snap judgments . let's move cautiously . first , this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it
they can bill me . i got a tab running . what's second ?
this is clearly an important species we're dealing with here . we can't just arbitrarily exterminate them
bullshit !
don't make me pull rank , ripley .
what rank ? i believe corporal hicks has authority here .
corporal hicks ! ?
this operation is under military jurisdiction and hicks is next in chain of command . right ?
those specimens are worth millions to the bio weapons division . now , if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes . set up for life .
you just try getting a dangerous organism past icc quarantine . section of the commerce code .
you've been doing your homework . look , they can't impound it if they don't know about it .
but they will know about it , burke . from me . just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty seven colonists here
now , wait a second
you sent them to that ship . i just checked the colony log . directive dates six twelve seventy nine . signed burke , carter j .
look , maybe the thing didn't even exist , right ? and if i'd made it a major security situation , the administration would've stepped in . then no exclusive rights , nothing .
sorry to disappoint you .
i've isolated a neuro muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis . it seems to be metabolizing . he should wake up soon .
now let me get this straight . the aliens paralyzed the colonists , carried them over there , cocooned them to be hosts for more of those .
yes . that follows .
but these things come from eggs . so where are all the eggs coming from .
that is the question of the hour . we could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization . an ant of termite colony , for example , is ruled by a single female , a queen , which is the source of new eggs .
you're saying one of those things lays all the eggs ?
well , the queen is always physically larger then the others . a termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all . it is fed and tended by drone workers , defended by the warriors . she is the center of their lives , quite literally the mother of their society .
could it be intelligent ?
hard to say . it may have been blind instinct . attraction to the heat of whatever . but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves . that's if she exists , of course .
how long until it blows ?
i'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours . the blast radius will be about thirty kilometers . about equal to ten megatons .
and it's too late to shut it down ?
i'm afraid so . the crash did too much damage . the overload is inevitable , at this point .
what ?
i'm really the only one qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway . believe me , i'd prefer not to . i may be synthetic but i'm not stupid .
all right . let's get on it . what'll you need ?
see you soon .
how much time ?
plenty ! twenty six minutes !
we're not leaving !
ripley .
she's alive . they brought her here and you know it .
in seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of nebraska .
you did okay , bishop .
well , thanks , i
. that's better . pan it around a bit .
awright . fire team a . gear up . let's move . two minutes . somebody wake up hicks .
okay , let's do it .
awright ! i want a nice clean dispersal this time .
set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast . immediate dust off on my 'clear , ' then stay on station .
ten seconds , people . look sharp !
first squad up , on line . hicks , get yours in a cordon . watch the rear .
vasquez , take point . let's move .
flame units only . i want rifles slung .
let's go . pull 'em out .
uh , . apone , i want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the apc , over .
say again ? all after incinerators ?
this floor's freezing .
christ . i never saw such a buncha old women . you want me to fetch your slippers , hudson ?
would you , sir ?
let's go . let's go . cycle through !
hey , 'top . ' what's the op ?
rescue mission . there's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity .
movement !
position ?
can't lock up .
talk to me , hudson .
uh , seems to be in front and behind .
it is .
how can i go ?
put on your wash and wear suit and your clip on tie , have your landlady tie your shoes for you , and show up at the church . simple . me and carol are going .
what ?
hey , look we've known kristin since . since she was conceived in that cabin up in big bear . remember ? you and edie banged the wall so hard , me and carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week .
goddammit , tug i want to see kristin get married , okay ? but
but you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing .
shit , if kristin had to get married where i could afford it , we'd be holding the reception at buddy's burgers .
whatever gave you that idea ?
you got your vest ?
of course . right in the trunk of the car .
yeah , that's comforting . mine , too .
watch the driver . i'm going for a better angle on the door .
i got him . don't get pinned .
i can't ! do you mind !
i'll cover you ! get outta there !
yeah , sykes ?
captain . i'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective .
you are to have nothing to do with the investigation into bill tuggle's death . you know that . leave that for fedorchuk .
departmental policy .
you ?
granger and pitts have one hell of a caseload . and i would have thought with jetson here being the first newcomer plainclothes , and hubley's body being found over in the newcomer community .
don't tell me what to think .
you know i've been over all this with fedorchuk and alterez this morning .
come on . you got nothin' better to do , cushy county job like yours .
yeah , right . don't push your luck . anyway , according to the sheet , the guy you nailed outside by the car
the human ?
yeah . he was one martin helder . white male , twenty seven . let's see . wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction , a couple for sale of a controlled substance . oh yeah , and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock .
fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets .
you took this gut out , too , didn't you ?
yeah .
lucky for you , you got him in both of his . well , what we loosely refer to as . hearts .
lucky nothing . i had to empty my damn gun into him .
that's the way these people are . you don't hit both pumps you just piss them off .
yeah , i'll bet .
you mean the blob ? they're finishing up now .
what kind of test ?
looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day .
did he find anything ?
ss'kya'ta' .
what's that ?
yeah . i seen him around . high roller dude named strader . joshua strader . runs a club on the west side . encounters .
yeah , i heard of it .
that's all i know . you want anything more , you ask somebody else .
here's hubley . left quarantine on november thirtieth , relocated first to riverside , then moved to los angeles early in february the following year . field of expertise chemical manufacturing . looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery .
try joshua strader , will ya , darlin' ?
for you , anything .
yeah we met him . wonderful boy . close personal friend of george's here .
i'm sorry , matt . nothing here seems to be matching up .
can you dig up their quarantine records in this thing ?
sure . just a minute .
mr . hubley was an all right guy and a damn good manager . the men liked him . i'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes .
well , one of the men didn't like him so much .
you think this is the guy who did it ?
we think he could'a been involved , yeah . you know him ?
to be honest , it's hard to say . i hate to admit it but they all still kinda look alike to me .
who else can i ask around here ?
wait . you know who it looks like ? yeah . anderson . uh . james anderson . he isn't in today . he took the afternoon off .
i think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off .
yes it is . thirty five percent pure methane gas in there . i don't know how these fellas do it .
don't piss him off , o'neal . when he gets like this , i can't control him . i've seen this before . he got like this once i saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him . nothing i could do . i hadda go throw up .
. they took the stuff out , all of it this afternoon .
you said you wanted the biggest thing i could find . well , this is it .
what is it ?
casull . magnum . you're talking twice the impact energy of . magnum hot loads .
only holds five .
yeah , the shells are too big for six in an cylinder . hell , matt , you don't need but one .
no . two .
sergeant . i'd like to thank you for what you're doing .
what's that ? look , jetson . get this straight in your head . we're not pals , we're not married , and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together . we're just partners . and don't call me sergeant . call me sykes . or matt if you have to .
i am george .
man , somebody really hung one on you ! i've heard some good ones for you guys . humphrey bogart , harley davidson . i guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while , coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you . you weren't at the back of the line , were you , george ?
my true name is ss'tangya t'ssorentsa' .
gesundheit . you don't mind if i stick to george , do you ?
that is exactly so . it is like your name . sykes . i'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like ss'ai k'ss , two words in my language which mean excrement and cranium .
let's talk hubley .
his body was discovered three days ago , in an alley off of central avenue , near downtown .
with two bri sabot slugs in the chest .
through the chest . rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts .
nice signal , dickwad !
there was no wallet . but he was still wearing a watch and two rings .
the guys at the mini mart last night made a half assed stab at the money in the till but i don't think that's what they were there for . i think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands , george .
the murder at the mini mart is not our case . the captain said
look , you want to fit in here , right ? you want to learn how to get along ?
yes .
well , there's a thing about partners , about being somebody's partner . you do for each other . and other people's rules don't mean shit . it's the rules set up between the two of you , that's all that counts . understand ? okay . well , my friend and partner was shot last night and i'm after the shitbag that did it . as my partner , i'm asking you to respect me and help me find him .
what is wrong ?
nothing's wrong . i just want to get something straight . you agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related , right ?
well . yes , quite possibly .
possibly . good . well , would you be willing to accept the theory , george , that . possibly . by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other ? does that sound unreasonable to you ?
yes . no , it is not unreasonable . although i
great . well , i'm sure glad that's settled , aren't you ?
nothing .
nothing ?
shouldn't we examine their personal effects ?
a rubber . a condom . you know . coney island whitefish ? men , human men , put them on their , uh penises to protect against having babies . you need this for anything ?
and that fits ?
well . yeah , it's rubber . it stretches .
and still it fits ?
how the hell do you know that ?
a large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us . my spouse's brother is one .
so the slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like hubley worked at a refinery . i'd say that possible connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible . okay , next step i gotta go talk to the wife of the slag store owner blown away last night .
i believe i should interview the widow alone .
why the hell ? ! great , fine . you talk to the wife .
mrs . porter is not taking her husband's death well .
did you learn anything ?
a week ago two men came to see her husband . after they left , he was very frightened . she identified one of the men from a photo i showed her . it was hubley .
aw right . what about the other guy ?
she didn't know him . but she said her son might .
did you talk to him ?
he has not been home since that day . but she told me where to find him .
rudyard kipling ? no shit ? listen , we just need a minute of your time .
we'd like to ask you about a business associate of your , warren hubley .
why'd i do what ?
agree to work with me ? you don't like me . you don't like any of us . you have nothing but contempt for us . and yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner .
my partner is dead ! because one of you bastards killed him then disappeared into a rathole down in slagtown , where he's home and dry , 'cause nobody sees nothing , nobody says nothing .
at the end of the bar .
your name wouldn't happen to be porter , would it ?
uh , matthew .
back off , george .
but i .
i'll handle it .
screw you .
screw me ? that can't be right .
your mother mates out of season .
that's very colorful . but see now i've got a problem . i don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you , porter . so i guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office , ya know ?
matthew , you don't have to .
stay back ! i'm okay .
from quarantine , when my people first arrived here . he and i were housed together .
how could a straight arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him ?
in the camps , we were lodged four to a room . the selection process was entirely random . we did not get to stay with our friends . or families .
yeah , sure . i knew that .
three months . we learn quickly . we adapt . it is our strength . what we were bred for , to adapt to hostile environments .
which one is that ? raw what ?
this is mole . it's good .
i'll bet . would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two ?
our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked .
so what was that other word for human . slow ka ?
ss'loka' . it means literally small but intelligent creature . it loses much in the translation .
and what was that one about my mother ? that was a good one .
ss'trokya ss'lato 'na' .
yeah , that's it . say it slow .
todd watson . the assistant manager .
we were chasing you because you ran , you dumb son of a bitch .
when will strader return ?
through his ass . next time you see him , tell him to call me . unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes .
my wife ? she worries about me .
yeah . i know the routine .
you are married ?
was . divorced .
we mate for life . divorce . is a strange concept to us .
it's like having an eleventh finger removed . it hurts like hell , but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place .
your home is quite disordered . i thought perhaps you had been burglarized when i walked in .
i appreciate your honesty , george .
human children can be very beautiful . getting married ? congratulations . you will be taking sunday off , then .
maybe not . i don't know . i'm not sure i'm gonna go . she doesn't need her burn out of a father there .
in the other man's rectum .
sticking out of his ass . yeah ! see , that's what makes it a joke . there's like a surprise , and your mind fills in the funny picture . here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer . nada , huh ?
ta ss'trakyona' .
no shit , holmes . you're only from another goddamn planet , for chrissakes .
you humans are very curious to us . you invite us to live among you , in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before . you lay before us a beautiful green world , full of freedoms and opportunities . you give us ownership of our lives for the first time . and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves to live by the rules . rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another , but rules that exist to preserve equality . you aspire to very high ideals here .
don't count on me , george . i never had any ideals .
i'm going home .
yeah , go home . get some sleep . you do sleep , don't you ?
a man , a human , was wiring it to your car . i didn't get a good look at him . i must call my wife .
george , she's not gonna divorce you . you mate for life , remember ?
she's very progressive . i'm certain she's considering it .
well , let's roll , george .
to the . to the beach ?
come on , let's go , dude . surf's up !
stop the car .
why ?
please , i must get out here .
come on , you won't have to get near the water .
stop the car !
it's all right , george . it's cool . just wait here , all right ? i'll be back in a coupla minutes .
thank you .
nothing .
warren hubley was in middle management at a refinery . joshua strader operated a successful bar and nightclub .
. and porter ran a piece of shit mom and pop mini mart . so what the hell's the connection ?
you must leave me alone on this .
no secrets , goddammit ! you don't hold back from me . whatever is going on , you're gonna tell me now !
no . i cannot involve you . this is not your concern .
the hell it isn't , when somebody wires up enough c explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist ! that slag was on something , and not sour milk , either ? am i right ? tell me ! what is it ?
. it is called ss'jabroka' . to us it is a potent narcotic .
how potent ?
like your cocaine , i suppose . the high lasts several hours . we would receive small amounts of it . as a reward for our labor .
we ? you've taken it ?
we all did .
where did he get it ? was there any of it on the ship ?
no . i am sure not . that is why i am so concerned . someone must now be producing it here . but none of my people know how to make it . the process was carefully guarded .
jesus , this is major . why didn't you tell me sooner ? why'd you hold out on me ?
your people don't know about this part of out past . and they can't know it would threaten our entire existence here .
george . look me in the eye . george , you don't ever lie to me again .
i must trust you , matthew . i cannot stop this without you .
harcourt was the brain who brought it all together .
if the drug is here , we must destroy it .
no , george you're missing the point . the drug is evidence . we need to have the evidence , ya know ?
where is the drug ? where have they taken it ?
george , uh . you're gonna break his little chest bones .
stay out of this , matthew . tell me where the drug has been taken or i will crush your lungs against this wall .
george , c'mon lighten up . it's a beauty of a case . don't sweat it we got him by the short hairs . he ain't gonna make any more of the shit .
the fifty kilos , matthew . i have to find it . i can't let it get out on the street .
why ? what's the big goddamn deal ?
shit !
ss ai !
it'd be for your own good . i think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more . by the book . . still , i gotta tell you , george , for a quiet guy , you're sure hell on wheels once you get going . i'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective .
there ! go back . down that side street .
do what ? ! george ? !
. it's harcourt .
harcourt is dead .
no he's not . not if he overdosed on the drug . massive amounts trigger a . a change . your body functions seize up , you appear to be dead , but it's really a state of incubation . when you emerge you're .
tell me about it .
we can't let him get away .
why the hell are you so dead set against back up ?
because . because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming .
but there's no more drug .
you understand that . but how many others will ?
how do i look ?
you look very good .
that cop , the human , he was the one who killed anderson and the driver .
this is becoming a serious breach of security .
he didn't recognize me .
it is his new partner that i'm worried about .
when we picked him up , he was talking to those two cops the two who came to question you about hubley .
this is getting out of hand . i want you to deal with it . immediately .
here ?
do it !
william harcourt ?
yes .
i'm sergeant sykes , and this is detective jetson , los angeles police department .
sergeant . detective . i wasn't aware there were any newcomers at the rank of detective yet .
you were partners with him on some slag uh , newcomer real estate thing .
that's right . he and i , along with seven or eight others . listen , gentlemen , i will be happy to assist you in any way i can unfortunately , at the moment , i'm overdue at another function .
move a finger , harcourt , and you're history .
no , sergeant not history . eternity .
so what've you got on tuggle's killers ?
jesus , sykes it's been less than ten hours . me and alterez are on it , okay ?
you don't have squat .
you ever try to make a case in slagtown ? the list of newcomer informants is about as long as the list of mexican war heroes .
i'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid , fedorchuk . see how much surfin' you'd do .
well , if it isn't detective jetson . forget you hip waders , big guy ?
lay off , asshole .
i may be an asshole , but at least i'm a real detective , not some outer shit space thing .
you are cassandra ?
that's right .
we are with the police department . this is sergeant sykes , and i am
ss'ai k'ss ? perfect .
the young woman at the front said you might know where he is .
she did , did she ? well , she was wrong . excuse me , i have to change .
show me .
oooh . hardball . that sounds interesting . are you going to strike me ? you could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me . i've got my own ropes .
does that cost extra or you throw them in ?
you've got me all wrong . i don't charge money for something that i myself find pleasurable .
the girl out front mentioned strader's assistant , somebody named watson . maybe he knows .
todd ? todd doesn't know either .
not unless i got real drunk and nobody told me about it later .
a virgin . i find that very arousing .
there's lots of things i haven't done , but his ain't high on the list . don't take it personally .
i think you're just a little scared now , about what you might find once the lights go out . a little scared . and a lot curious . maybe more than you want to admit . but doesn't that turn you on , that curiosity and fear , swirling together ? think of it as broadening your horizons .
i like my horizons narrow .
your voice is saying no , but your body is saying yes .
you okay ?
yeah .
thank you .
do you feel all right , sir ?
oh i haven't flown for a long time .
excuse me , sir . would you like some coffee before we serve dinner ?
no . no thank you .
excuse me , sir . there's been a little problem in the cockpit and i was wondering .
the cockpit ? what is it ?
it's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit . but that's not important right now . the first officer is ill and the captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio . do you know anything about planes ?
well , i flew in the war , but that was a long time ago . i wouldn't know anything about it .
would you go up , please ?
thank you , randy . you better leave sweetheart . you might get hurt in here .
excuse me , sister ?
yes ?
there's a little girl on board who's ill and .
oh yes , i saw . poor child .
could i borrow your guitar ? i thought i might be able to cheer her up .
of course .
sorry , clarence . latest weather report shows everything socked in from salt lake to lincoln .
hi , roger . good to have you aboard . victor , this is roger murdock .
huh ?
roger .
huh ?
roger , roger . what's our vector , victor ?
do you want me to check the weather , clarence ?
no , why don't you take care ot it ?
all right . but just remember , my name is roger murdock .
would either of you like another cup of coffee ?
i will , but jim won't .
yes ?
oh , stewardess . my husband is very sick . can you do something , please ?
well , the doctor will be with you in just a moment . one thing do you know what he had for dinner ?
yes , of course . we both had fish . why ?
oh , it's nothing to be alarmed about . we'll get back to you very quickly .
hi !
i'm randy .
i'm lisa . oh , you have a guitar !
i thought maybe you'd like to hear a song .
oh , i'd love to .
okay , this is one of my favorites .
wait a minute . i know you . you're kareem abdul jabbar . you play basketball for the los angeles lakers !
i'm sorry , son , but you must have me confused with someone else . my name is roger murdock . i'm the co pilot .
you u are u kareem . i've seen you play . my dad's got season tickets !
i think you should go back to your seat now , joey . right , clarence ?
i think you're the greatest . but my dad says you don't work hard enough on defense .
denver control , this is flight two zero niner intersecting victor airway seven niner niner .
. and that lots of times you don't even run down court .
we are turning left to a heading of zero niner niner .
. and that you don't really try , except during the playoffs .
the hell i don't ! i'm out there busting my buns every night .
jack , isn't that fred bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck ? maybe he's on our flight to chicago .
yeah , i think he is . hey , fred !
well , it wasn't all that i had hoped .
what is it ?
oh jack , i'm so warm . i'm burning up .
here .
and get that finger out of your ear . you don't know where that finger's been ! gunderson ?
yes , captain ?
did you decide on a runway yet ?
runway niner . it's the longest , and directly into the wind .
you are now eight miles from the airport . turn right to a heading of zero eight niner , throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet .
he's all over the place ! nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet ! what an asshole !
watch your altitude , striker . it's too erratic . you can't come straight in . you've got enough fuel left for two hours flying . you've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather .
he's right on the heading .
all right , he's on final now ! put out all runway lights except niner .
oh , bill , i'm going to miss you so much .
you promise you'll write .
every day .
good bye , darling .
oh , bill , i'll keep it . i'll keep it with me all the time .
so long , darling . good bye . take care of yourself .
bill ! bill ! good bye , bill .
good bye , darling .
good bye , darling . i love you . i love you , darling .
good bye , darling .
we have a visitor .
hello .
we'd better get back now .
joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to .
who wants to be first ?
airsick ?
i think so , but i've never seen it so acute .
find out if there's a doctor on board , as quietly as you can .
elaine !
ted !
i came home early and found your note . i guess you meant for me to read it later . elaine , i've got to talk to you .
i just don't want to go over it any more .
i know things haven't been right for a long time , but it'll be different . if you'll just be patient , i can work things out .
i have been patient and i've tried to help , but you wouldn't even let me do that .
don't you feel anything for me at all any more ?
it takes so many things to make love last . most of all it takes respect . and i can't live with a man i don't respect !
look , you'll be back in town tomorrow night . we'll have dinner talk it over .
i won't be back . i've requested the atlanta run .
elaine , not yet . i promise you i really can change .
then why don't you take the job that louie netz offered you at boeing ?
you know i haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war . and even if i could , they wouldn't hire me because of my war record .
your u war u u record u ? you're the only one keeping that alive . for everyone else it's ancient history .
you expect me to believe that ?
it's the truth . what's hurt you the most is your record since the war . different cities , different jobs , and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility .
but if you'll just give me .
it's too late , ted . when i get back to chicago , i'm going to start my life all over again . i'm sorry .
elaine , i've got to talk to you .
you . you shouldn't have come . i don't have time now .
my orders came through . my squadron ships out tomorrow . i'll be leading a very important mission .
oh , ted , please be careful . i worry about you so much .
i love you , elaine .
i love you .
elaine , just hear me out . i know things haven't been right for a long time . but it will be different . like it was in the beginning . remember ?
i remember everything . all i have are memories .
that's the way i've always wanted it to be , elaine .
but it won't be . not as long as you insist on living in the past !
headquarters ! ? what is it ?
it's a big building where the generals meet . but that's not important right now . they've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid . isn't that good news ?
is it ? because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid .
seven . lieutenant zipp died this morning . ted , doctor sandler says you'll be out in a week . isn't that wonderful ?
i wish i could say the same for george zipp .
be patient , ted . no one expects you to get over this immediately .
that's lieutennt hurwitz . severe shell shock . he thinks he's ethel merman .
ted , i don't want to stay here . it's time for us to go back home to the plans we made before the war .
a lot of people made plans before the war . like george zipp .
ted ! what are you doing ? you can't fly this plane !
that's what i've been trying to tell these people .
rain .
and a little ice .
and a little ice !
sluggish . like a wet sponge .
sluggish . like a wet sponge .
it's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much i hate his guts .
it's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts .
rats ! i've lost number three .
what happened , ted ? what went wrong ?
oil pressure . i forgot to check the oil pressure . when kramer hears about this , the shit's gonna hit the fan .
but ted , you're the only .
i don't care . i just don't have what it takes . they'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before .
ted .
yes ?
i wanted you to know now i'm very proud .
tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land .
the gear is down .
see them , elaine ?
uh huh .
that's right .
we have some passengers who are very sick . could you come and take a look at them ?
yes . yes , of course .
a hospital ? what is it ?
it's a big building with patients . but that's not important right now . tell the captain i must speak to him .
certainly .
what was it we had for dinner tonight ?
well , we had a choice . steak or fish .
yes , yes , i remember . i had lasagna .
he had fish .
let's see now . the co pilot had fish . what did the navigator eat ?
he had fish , too .
extremely serious . it starts with a slight fever .
no .
all right . unless i can get all these people to a hospital quickly , i can't even be sure of saving their lives . now , is there anyone else on board who can land this plane ?
well .
i think you ought to know what our chances are . the life of everyone on board depends on just one thing finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane , but who didn't have fish for dinner .
i can't tell .
can't you take a guess ?
well . not for another two hours .
you can't take a guess for another two hours ?
no , i mean we can't u land u for another two hours . fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains . we've got to go through to chicago !
i'm not sure . i haven't seen anything like this since the lina wertmuller film festival .
both pilots !
can you fly this airplane and land it ?
surely you can't be serious .
i u am u serious , and don't call me shirley ! what flying experience have you had ?
well , i flew single engine fighters in the air force , but this plane has four engines . it's an entirely different kind of flying . u all u u together u !
elaine , i haven't time to put this gently , so i'll be very direct . everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation . mister striker is the only hope we've got .
let's see . those are the flaps , that's the thrust , this must turn on the landing lights .
. safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment .
chicago , the passengers are beginning to panic . when do we start down ?
will the hospital equipment be at the airport ?
yes , everything they've got . how are the passengers doing ?
i won't deceive you , mister striker . we're running out of time .
surely there must be something you can do .
i'm doing everything i can ! and stop calling me shirley !
george zipp said that ?
and the last thing he said to me , doc , he said , sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys , tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the zipper . i don't know where i'll be then , doc , he said , but i won't smell too good . that's for sure .
excuse me , doc , i've got a plane to land .
hello , i'm paul carey from the airline . i'm here to pick up captain kramer .
oh , yes . come in , paul . rex will be right out .
well , to tell the truth , they really didn't fill me in on many of the details . just told me to pick up captain kramer .
something about a plane with no pilot ?
yeah , something like that , but as i say , they didn't have time to tell me very much .
shep , no ! i'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there .
. but after . awhile . you begin to . . get used to it .
shep , no ! he gets so excited when new people are here .
i happened to be passing , and i thought you might like some corfee .
that's very nice of you . thank you .
thank you . cream ?
no , thank you . i take it black . like my men .
were you vacationing in los angeles ?
well , it really wasn't a vacation . you see , i'm a teacher in the new york city school system , and i was attending a seminar on visual aids to education . are you from l . a . ?
no . i'm from washington , d . c . i'm a lobbyist for the small businessmen's assocation .
well , after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to .
but i think it's time we stopped talking about me . a woman like you why haven't you ever married ?
well , i'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer .
i know the answer career . a smart woman like you became so involved in your work , you didn't have time for marriage .
i wish i could fool myself into believing that that's the reason . the truth of the matter is , nobody ever asked me .
you know , here we are having coffee together , and discussing education and business and economy . and we don't even know each other's names . full names i mean .
mine's eleanor . eleanor schiff .
that's a lovely name . mine's milton . milt ettenhenim . but my friends call me 'bubbles . '
no . i'm all alone .
just in case i don't have a chance to say goodbye , i want you to know that i haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years .
that's a very nice compliment , and i'd like to say that . you've done the same for me .
uh . oh , thank you . it's nothing .
you don't have to thank me , i'm a nurse . this is my father , dr . barrington .
not dr . barrington , the world renowned agronomist ?
yes . he's dying u a n d u wants to be buried on mercury .
i'm familiar with your work , doctor . you'll have to excuse me , i have to go .
you don't have to excuse yourself . i'm a nurse . i understand .
i'm getting over it . if a relationship isn't working , you can't force it .
no , i mean your head . sit down . i'll take a look at it . i'm a nurse .
i opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me .
no . i mean your relationship .
we were in love but i'm not sure i know what love is anymore .
love's the same as it always was . it's people who change .
people change in relation to each other . love changes on its own .
not if the people change together in relation to that love .
sure . but that's only when the love itself goes unchanged .
then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love .
i just wish it was that simple . we really were in love . you know how it is when you laugh all the time .
no . it's hard to l a u g h when your father's dying .
well , we laughed . we laughed all the time .
that's right , striker . and we're getting married when we return .
look at this wiring . it's shorting out under high temperatures .
you're tired , striker , overworked . that wiring meets all the safety specifications .
i know you've been subtly spreading the word that i'm having a breakdown .
striker .
kurtz , you're drunk . who's in command of this ship ?
that damn computer has taken over . i'm getting out .
then elaine was right .
don't talk to me about elaine . outta my way !
pull yourself together ! we've got to .
do you have an appointment , sir ?
no , dammit . it's a matter of life or death .
you'll have to be more specific than that , sir .
all right , it's a matter of death .
death , death . how about the first thursday in march , ten o'clock .
don't try to stop me !
but that's not a door . the door's over there .
you folks need any help ?
thanks , but we have a terrific woman in on thursdays .
say , isn't that dr . barrington , the world renowned agronomist ?
yes .
it's a privilege to meet you , sir , i'm familiar with all your work .
let's go , daddy . we have to check in . he was never appreciated at the institute .
ah , yes , the institute , i'm familiar with it .
now he's d y i n ging and wants to be buried on mercury .
captain oveur ?
mr . kurtz , i presume .
we don't have much time . let's move . i'll explain everything .
do you think it's necessary to explain u everything u ?
captain oveur , your navigator , mr . unger , and your first officer , mr . dunn .
yes , sir , commander . this is mercury one . everything seems a okay up here and ready for count down .
which passenger is joe salucci ?
sixteen 'c' , why ?
he's carrying a bomb .
a b .
no , a bomb . now , as discreetly as possible , i want you to move the passengers into the lounge .
what should i say ?
anything . just don't let salucci think we're onto him .
a couple eggs and juice would be nice , mary . over .
how would you like your eggs , captain ? over .
no . poached . over .
poached u and u over , captain oveur ? over .
just poached on toast . over .
all right , captain oveur . over .
poached ! not over ! over !
captain , the coffee machine is jammed and i don't like it .
have you tried it with a little cinnamon ?
joe , you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people .
i don't want to live anymore .
joe , the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids . you bought auto insurance , not life insurance .
what ?
that's right , joe . now , no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you .
you're sure ?
i'm sure .
take this , joey . it's my last few bucks . you'll need a hot meal when you get there .
we've spent everything on these operations . is it really worth it ? we've pawned your mother's wedding ring . the kids have no winter clothes .
joey , what's more important , the kids' clothes or your sexual potency .
i don't want to hear that word !
okay , joey . the doc says you gotta relax . this hospital in des moines is the best sex clinic in the country .
all right . here .
what . ?
come on up , jimmy . say , that's some puppy . what's his name ?
scraps .
can i hold him ?
sure .
he's a boy dog .
yeah .
do you like it when scraps sleeps on his back , jimmy ?
will scraps be able to sit with us , dad ?
we'll have to check , jimmy . it's a pretty long trip to mercury .
i sure an glad they let scraps ride up here with us .
i bet scraps is going to love mercury .
do you think things will be a lot different on mercury , dad ?
it's going to be terrific . a whole new world , new kids to play with .
no more kids yelling , 'your old man's a thieving rapist' ?
look , a man can make an honest mistake ! anyway , she was asking for it ! they're all asking for it all the time !
intermitant failure in scan mode r . analyze .
negative .
that doesn't make sense . repeat analysis .
negative .
that's not possible .
cut the doubting thomas shit , elaine . i know where i'm coming from on this .
that's okay , rok .
can i say something of a personal nature to you ?
go ahead .
you have great tits .
request comprehensive electrical systems check .
systems check positive . look , elaine , i .
request life support systems check .
life support check . elaine , it's obvious you've been ignoring me . you're a woman . i can relate to that .
request self analysis of rok hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes .
there's nothing wrong with me , elaine . what about tonight just you and me . we can be alone . i can get rid of everyone else on the ship i've already proven u that u .
elaine , ask rok for a field interference scan . those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications .
yes , sir .
i see . what do you think our alternatives are ?
we have to disconnect rok's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system .
roger .
you can do it from up here , captain .
i'd rather sit down for this one , elaine .
no , i mean you can do it from the cockpit .
roger . you better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit .
for the best little computer officer on the mercury mission .
simon .
who would believe that elaine thompson was once a stewardess on the denver chicago run .
and i can hardly believe that i'm engaged to someone like you , simon . i'm a very lucky woman .
women u and u the space program have come a long way , sweetheart . but after the wedding , no more complicated computers for my little girl .
but , darling , they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the jupiter probe .
you're heading up the division in charge of babies for mr . and mrs . simon kurtz .
i'm so excited , simon .
i guess this is a first for you .
no , i've been excited before .
elaine ! ted's a danger to himself , he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the middle east .
simon , why has he become so . so .
so mentally ill ?
don't be too long .
have you got it straightened out now ?
i think so .
that's my girl .
simon , i'm going to check rok's secondary readout unit .
roger .
simon , what's happening ? !
he tried to disconnect rok . it gassed him . that computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun .
can't we change course ?
we're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down .
your career ! what about the lives of those people out there . simon , what happened to the man i thought i loved ?
maybe .
simon , what are you saying ? !
the human brain is a highly complex organ , elaine , perhaps the most complex next to the bladder . let me show you . ted's problem is in this area . this area , this area , here , here , here , under here , here .
what can u i u do , doctor rumack ?
you can eat balanced meals , exercise , and take geritol .
i mean for ted .
you can be gentle with him , elaine . he's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden .
is that a good sign , doctor ?
the brain is an amazingly complex organ , elaine .
is he making any progress , doctor ?
yes last week that pile of mud was only this high .
elaine .
te . !
that's not important now , elaine . we have to talk .
but , ted , the invitations have already gone out .
i mean the mercury flight . it's not safe and , kurtz , you know why .
ted , what's wrong ?
ask simon .
ted , you're overworked . you've been flying yourself into the ground .
there's nothing wrong with me !
let's relax tonight , just the two of us . i'll make a quiet italian dinner just the way you like it , with spaghetti .
you're as bad as the rest of them , elaine ! it's all here in the design specifications ! look ! it's all here !
ted , please . you're just making things difficult for yourself .
elaine , what happened to us ?
ted , i loved you and i'll always love you . but i need simon . he's stable . he's a good provider . i want that at this stage of the game , ted . he might have his faults , but simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and i need that in a man .
sammy davis junior . terrible car accident . he hasn't been the same since .
and when are you going to realize , ted , that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now .
his name's david stockman . he's been here twenty years , that's all he says .
ted , you must remember what the doctor said , the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick . now take your electro shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time . and by the way , ted , i'm leaving you for simon .
no goodbyes , elaine . just go .
if that's the way you want it .
that's the way i want it . just turn the radio on and go .
goodbye , ted . i don't want to hurt you .
i have to get in there . i have to stop this flight .
ted , we're taking off !
let me by , elaine .
what are you doing , ted ?
i've got it , elaine ! i've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle !
ted .
not now , elaine !
ted !
elaine .
ted . i don't know why you got on this flight . i don't know what you're trying to prove .
elaine , we have to go back .
we can't go back . we had something very special , but it's all over .
elaine , i mean the mission has to be aborted . this ship should never have passed fsa inspection . this thing is held together by string and chewing gum .
ted , get a grip on yourself . you should never have left the hospital .
then you u do u think i'm insane .
i've never used the word insane , ted .
what word would you use , elaine ?
the word is sick . ted very , very , very sick .
what would you say if i told you the toilet just blew up in my face .
i'd use the word insane .
there's something dangerously wrong with this ship , elaine . i know its the wiring . that toilet's just the tip of the iceberg .
ted , a toilet's not going to kill anyone .
elaine !
ted !
elaine , what's going on ?
ted , there's no time to explain .
elaine , i'm going back there . just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can .
ted , please be careful .
not now , elaine .
i mean until we start to burn up .
kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place . you people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly . you played god with over a hundred lives , kruger , and for what the prestige of your precious space program .
that was very well put , ted .
well , elaine , this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something .
i just want you to know , i love you ted and always will .
that might be the news we've been waiting for .
simon just ejected !
sit down , elaine . if this bomb trick works we just might make it . simon was a fool to eject now .
you mean .
that's right premature ejection .
what will happen to him , ted ?
the sun will heat that thing to over degrees within seconds . he'll roast like a pig on a spit .
not when i'm with you , ted .
i guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this .
set !
now !
compute !
kramer , the worp control handle just came off in my hand .
oveur .
dunn .
accelerators down .
you better check it , unger .
sir , i've got an overload in disposal unit four .
you better check on it , mr . dunn . i'll stay here and fly the ship .
sir ?
you better take this .
did you feel that ?
yes i did .
felt like a large asteroid .
yes it did . mr . dunn , can i ask you a personal question ?
what is it , mary ?
um . do you people scream right when you . you know .
commissioner , we both know the mercury shuttle needs another month of pre launch testing .
forget it . the boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule .
and what do the boys on the board know about safety , commissioner ? let u me u talk to them .
bud , get wise to the political realities . the boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown .
commissioner .
what ?
i just wish it was that simple .
that just doesn't make any sense .
i wonder how your boys in washington are going to take this one .
i told you , leave the boys in washington to the boys downtown and the boys down .
you've made your point , commissioner . there's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's clarence oveur . he's got a lunar flight today . i want him pulled . jacobs , pull oveur !
i was reading too .
what's the story ?
some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor .
i was asking mccrosky , commissioner .
commissioner , aquarius .
i always wondered if my freshman russian class would come in handy .
you wanna knock of f ?
no , no . i'm fine . what did the speaker say ?
he and the nra don't like the wording .
i might still have a few chips left .
we could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge . the second amendment types'll love that .
this is a crime bill , shep . killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee . besides , shep , i told you . i don't shoot babies and i don't kiss guns .
other way around , sir .
right . christ i'm tired . do me a favor and keep me away from the press .
sir , the speaker of the house attacked this administration on national television . you can't afford to leave that hanging .
did we tape the duke game ?
we'll just say it was in bad taste .
that's my job .
yes , sir .
okay . hey , pumpkin , you'll tell me all about it later , right ?
mr . president , how the hell did you get on board ?
i never left . where's my wife and daughter ?
sir .
my god . i think that was a mig .
a mig ? where the hell are we ?
iraq ? shep , you're fired .
how long's it been since you flew , sir ?
twenty five years .
twenty five minutes . they should be here any moment .
they better . fuel's almost gone .
it's open !
do you see teem ?
we're hooked !
we're hooked . hove into position .
white house switchboard . how may i direct your call .
okay listen , listen carefully . this is an emergency call from air force one . who's there ? is the vice president there ?
who can i say is calling ?
this is the president .
yeah , right .
don't cut me off . this is an emergency .
sir , the president does not call this particular number . so whoever you are get a life , before i have this call traced .
you don't understand . this is an emergency . let me talk to anyone .
okay . if you're the president , when's your wife's birthday ?
look lady , i don't have time for games . just put the .
thank you for calling the white house .
no . no . no . wait . wait .
we're under attack .
where's my family ?
we're handling it , sir .
but .
two . three . go !
did they say anything about my family ?
they're still alive , but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes .
then tell me there's a rescue operation underway .
and if that means negotiating .
you know my policy . we don't negotiate with terrorists . if we start now , all of america becomes a target .
but this is different , sir . you're the president .
freeing stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed . i can't live with that . i'm not royalty . i'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the president is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office . we don't negotitate . not as long as i'm president . is that understood ?
the fax machines .
excuse me ?
the fax machines .
no good . i said they disabled the communications system .
no . i thought about this , mr .
white house situation room .
actually , sir , you could be that someone .
may i speak to you for a moment ?
can't it wait ?
no , mr . president . it can't .
rose , i don't have time for this .
for godsakes , jim , slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy . not even you can plug all the world's leaks . don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on mtv news than in person .
she's a big girl . she understands .
how do you know she understands ? you haven't spent more than five minutes with her , or me , in weeks .
and when have i had five minutes ? when i wake up in the morning and i'm already three hours behind schedule . what do you want me to do , rose , tell the g to fuck off because i'm a family man ?
what ?
i miss you . and i miss her .
but that's the point , jim . we're right here .
i wish it were that easy .
i should trust that promise ? because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut .
this promise isn't subject to congressional approval .
how did your speech go ?
well , they aren't burning me in effigy . that's always a good sign .
shall i ask the chief of staff to schedule your daughter in ?
please . don't start with me .
both of you .
flying the plane .
you haven't even driven a car since you took office .
our kh ll's took this one at hours . what you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades .
they've gotta be joking .
the northern border's gotten a bit hairy . their migs are playing tag with our tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage .
tell our boys to cool their jets . i don't need em creating policy for me .
gravity .
we've already played our cards , major . there's no turning back .
we can't jump from here or at this speed . but if we could get a message out tell the refueling plane .
they've cut communication , and i spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives . my only solution ran out of batteries .
eighteen thousand feet , sir . and two hundred knots . otherwise it's suicide .
got it .
yes , sir .
that isn't necessary .
our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground . our hands are completely tied while they're in the air .
okay , gentlemen , we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane . lee , go huddle with the d . o . d . i want an options paper on this in minutes .
twenty minutes ?
you heard me . you . congress and cabinet heads .
madame vice president . we have an options paper . chandler takes the options paper , waves off lee , and reads it as she talks .
yes . you've made yourself quite clear .
finally , we can bargain .
i'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement . land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel .
now since we've had very little luck getting washington or moscow to cooperate , i wondered if you would be so kind .
over my dead body .
no . but since i only have a few of your staff left to kill , perhaps i will start with your family instead . gibbs .
she isn't a part of this . this is between you and me .
call up petrov and order stravanavitch' s release .
this administration does not negotiate with terrorists .
pity . mr . gibbs .
stop .
you'll do it ?
yes , i'll do it . just leave my family alone .
good . good .
someday , you'll regret my nature .
you don't like seeing people get hurt . now in morality , that is a virtue . in politics , however , that is weakness . you were a hostage to everyone else long before you were a hostage to
one thing i've learned as
there goes your ride .
let my daughter go or i'll take you out !
if you put down the gun , i promise not to drop her on the way down .
hold on , alice .
fear will keep you alive . any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish , and bound to die .
what do you want with us ?
cooperation . if you try to escape , you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting . good day .
come on , alice .
or you will do what , mrs . marshall ? but i admire your courage . your husband , on the other hand .
what do you know of my husband ?
i know he left you behind .
my husband is a very courageous man .
your husband is a coward . he sends soldiers half way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night .
do you have to be so brutal ?
yes
why ? do you enjoy it ?
i neither enjoy nor dislike . i do what is necessary .
how can you ? i mean they're people .
but they are not ny people . you look at me as if i am a monster , but answer me this when your planes bombed the oil fields of iraq , did you cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces you will never see ? did you cry for their wives and children . they were people too , yes . but they were not your people .
that was war .
so is this . come now , you're upsetting the little one .
no .
say something dear .
nor will there be . my husband does not negotiate with terrorists .
you will be the first to pay for that mistake .
please . you can kill me but leave my daughter alone .
four .
jim .
three .
you got what you wanted . you going to release us now ?
you're very valuable . and our nation needs so many things .
the president and i were delighted that we could accommodate you . now if you're all cleared ? you can follow me then .
this is a remarkable aircraft .
you don't know the half of it . did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation ? we could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary .
a dubious distinction , no ?
i guess it depends on your perspective .
and all these rooms here ?
conference rooms , though some have other functions . the one up front doubles as an emergency medical center .
thank you .
maria . maria mitchell .
and what is it you do , ms . mitchell .
i'm responsible for press relations for the flight office .
how are your fellow hostages feeling , ms . mitchell ?
scared . we're scared .
very good . thank you , ms . mitchell .
tower , air force one has been boarded .
romeo tango zulu , copy one the television , graphics of the first family against the presidential seal .
stand by .
romeo tango zulu this is tower .
we copy . stand by . tower ?
tower , here .
this is romeo tango zulu changing call signs . tower , alert air traffic , romeo tango zulu is now air force one . this is air force one . the president is safe onboard .
copy , air force one .
we've already been inspected .
sir , this plane carries the president of the united states .
the rest of the secret service ?
dead .
how many others killed ?
nine .
any of us ?
we checked the manifest . everyone was accounted for .
a secret service agent . it must be .
why did they do that ?
psychology . they're trying to unnerve us .
well it worked .
how ?
avionics compartment ! it's the only place . you better get zedeck down there fast unless , of course , you'd rather be a martyr than a savior .
go ! take serge . and watch your backs .
we've stopped dumping . but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left .
we're not going to make it .
not even close . hell , we can't even make syria or iraq .
where are we now ?
over the black sea . i can probably get us to turkey or georgia .
no ! if we land this plane anywhere else , we will end up another entebe . the americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud , evades missiles and . refuels in mid air . call the white house .
air force one , this is af ra . we have been instructed to refuel your plane .
about goddamn time .
please change course to zero seven four and drop to eighteen thousand feet . over .
air force one , acknowledged . tnt . emergency parachute launch ramp .
air force one , please reduce speed to knots .
roger .
ga get it .
special agent gibbs . you helped do this ?
yes , mr . president .
why ?
because it is my duty .
you're duty to what ? the country you served doesn't exist anymore .
my loyalty was never to my country .
general greely says it looks like the middle east .
does your office have anything to add , mr . dean ?
we've got four hours before they make it into turkienistan airspace .
but they start executing hostages in
i hate to be pragmatic , but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings . it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff .
okay . also , i want you to put our bases in turkey on alert , and have the kitty hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike .
like any good poker player , they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard .
if challenged , our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission .
iraqi's won't buy it . either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying .
if fired upon , tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage .
to swear you in as president .
sir , you threw out page two .
goddamn right i did . i asked for a tough as nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit . what's the point in having a speech if i have to ad lib ?
it was a good ad lib , sir .
thanks . wrote it last night .
apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be . representative taylor is working on a compromise .
put together a score sheet . i'll make some calls .
the iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise .
an exercise in futility . send the nimitz back in .
he's dead then . they must have killed him .
we don't know that .
holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands .
that kid's name was jim marshall .
they aren't answering their hails .
this doesn't make sense .
they've got no chutes . they can't control the plane , their engines are failing and they're losing fuel .
i prefered the terrorists .
that's game , set , and match . there's nothing to do , except call the chief justice .
u . s . pilots , this is air force one .
copy air force one . welcome to the party .
you read my mind .
put your pilot on .
he's busy being dead .
who's flying the fucking plane ?
i'm doing what i can .
two and three are heading toward the boeing .
got it .
stay cool .
how we doing , colonel ?
we still got three migs running around and six more on the way .
uh , we got a problem here .
just stay on my wing , sir . i'll take you all the way in .
no . we're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding .
lemme take a look .
sluggish . i think it's jammed too .
uh , tower , we got a problem up here .
do you see the maintenance panel ?
got it .
pop it open . there should be a red switch , toggle it up .
okay , it's on . we've got some indicator lights here .
okay , you're aerated . to dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump . there's no switch in avionics so you'll have to cross the wires . there should be five wires , just to your left . do you see them ?
it's cut .
cross it . the static overwhelms the voice , then cuts out .
the americans say they are escorting a damaged plane . our pilots confirm they are surrounding a .
did we warn them off ?
yes . they refused to alter course and the would not answer our hails .
it's some kind of trick . a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement .
they are in our airspace . we would be within our rights .
the world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner .
the pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet .
warn then again . if they don't respond . shoot them down . we will not be intimidated .
oooooh , i'm good .
hey , you guys back already ?
it was the experience of a lifetime .
how bout a hug for the old man .
daddy .
alice . i .
been better , dad . you ?
it's okay , honey . i got you . i got you . you're okay .
there they are !
okay , i'm slowing us down .
i don't drink coffee .
you must be tired . it'll wake you up .
no , thank you . the gunfire did that .
so , you study world events , little one . that's good for a girl your age .
yeah , i study world events . five thousand turkienistan muslims were slaughtered in stravanvitch's cleansings . along with american school kids . you know hqw i studied that . i went to their funerals with my dad . i met their parents .
smart for your age , eh ? top of your class ? tell me , do you know what the word quot propaganda quot means ?
yeah . do you know what the word quot asshole quot means .
that's the way of the world , little one . didn't they teach you that in school ?
fuck off , you stupid asshole .
it would be a pity to squander such a strong personality .
he didn't leave us .
you are a resilient man , mr .
it's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times .
well , you aren't the president , dear .
yeah , no duh .
you don't want to say hi to your father ?
i'm sure he's busy .
don't you even want to ask ?
hey joey , how bout a cocoa , double whip cream .
alice .
mom , just this once , give it a rest .
you're jet lagged . we'll talk about this back .
back at the fishbowl ?
we'll talk at home . you know , most girls aren't as lucky as you . for most girls seeing the bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime .
i know , mom . it was great . really .
i'm sorry , honey .
no , it's okay . after all , he is the president , right ?
your father never means to be so .
i know . but lotsa times i feel like it's me versus the world . some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in bangladesh . i mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important .
some kids were teasing you ?
that's not really the point .
you're right and i'll tell you a secret . i know exactly how you feel .
big secret . you said the same thing to newsweek .
yes dear ?
i'm sorry i was so mean to you earlier .
jim . for godsake !
wade ?
yeah , brother , look , i was calling cause has there been anything on tv in boston about a hunting accident with a guy named twombley , evan twombley ?
there was something . it happened up your way .
yeah , i know him the kid that was with him . maybe you do too . jack hewitt . he works for lariviere with me . he's my best friend .
wade , it's late . i know you're probably at toby's , but i'm in bed reading . we got different habits .
no , not tonight . i'm in bed too . i'm calling because i need you to listen . you're supposed to be a smart guy . you're a professor . i got this theory . jack says he didn't see twombley shot but he did .
he was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in new england and the construction business .
who ?
twombley .
no shit .
you think jack shot him ?
well , it was an accident .
they were out deer hunting , right ? jack probably heard the gun go off , then came back and found the body .
lillian was here . in lawford .
huh ?
the night before the shooting .
how was she ?
picked up jill . she was supposed to visit for the weekend for halloween . she wanted to go home .
who ?
jill . i was thinking of getting a lawyer . maybe you can help me .
what happened ?
a divorce lawyer . a custody lawyer . you know , 'cause of jill .
don't think about it . you're exhausted .
yeah , i guess .
get some sleep .
i get to feeling like a whipped dog some days , rolfe , and some night i'm going to bite back . i swear it .
haven't you already done a bit of that ?
no , no , i haven't . not really . i've growled a little , but i haven't bit .
what about jill ? is lillian bringing her ?
anyone else want one ? rolfe ?
no thanks . i don't drink .
yeah . i forgot .
what about margie ?
what about her ?
well , do you still plan to get married ?
yeah . she'll probably quit her job and stay out here with pop . we can't leave him alone here , he'll set the damn place on fire . with jill here a lot , it'll be good to have margie around . things are going to change in that department , by the way . i got a custody lawyer in concord . i'm gonna see him tomorrow . all hell's gonna break loose , but it's worth it .
anything new about the shooting ? twombley ?
i guess it was an accident , like everybody thinks .
want to know what i think happened ?
find them everywhere .
i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one .
which is ?
that it wasn't an accident .
then who shot him ?
well , your friend , i think . jack hewitt .
motive . you gotta have a motive .
money .
who'd pay him that kind of money ? not the mob . they got their own guys . specialists .
they wouldn't deal with a guy like jack . who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead ?
i don't know . you tell me .
okay . it's likely there are people in the union who don't want twombley to testify . they probably include his son in law who's vice president and will probably be the next president . i read that in the papers . what's his name , mel gordon ?
yeah , the guy with the bmw i told you about . i did , didn't i ?
here's my theory . twombley , unaware of illegal union loans or whatever , starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out . finds out his son in law is involved .
so mel gordon wouldn't want a professional hit . that'd make the feds dig deeper . he wants an accident .
a hunting accident is perfect .
shit , around here , you shoot somebody in the woods , you say it was an accident , you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted . jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled .
not particularly .
right's right , goddamnit ! don't you care what's right ?
i care about what happened . the truth . i'm a student of history , remember ?
yeah .
i hate to disappoint you , but i don't think it happened .
of course it happened . why would i lie about it ?
it may have happened , but not the way you said .
you think i wouldn't remember a thing like that ?
it wasn't me . i wasn't there , but i heard about it . when i heard about it , it was about elbourne .
we'd have to go digging in vietnam to ask him .
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft .
well , i never heard that one .
i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop . i was a careful child and i became a careful adult , but at least i wasn't afflicted by that man's violence .
that's what you think .
wade , are you alright ?
but you gotta hear this . you won't believe it . mel gordon had come by to visit lariviere and so now i'm in his office .
for what ?
to help , jack , of course and to nail those sonsofbitches , the two gordons . that's what alma calls them . jesus , rolfe , whose side are you on ?
take care of the little things first , the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things . call chub merritt , get your car back , call a dentist , for god's sake , and get your tooth pulled , don't trust the locals , get your facts straight and go straight to the state police . let them work on this .
rolfe .
a lesson in work and its rewards . you'll thank me for this one day . sally , turn off that tv !
just do it .
atta go .
nothing .
you no good pup !

i'm not finding fault . it's a good idea , good for you , good for the town . real modern too .
this town sucks .

the fucker shot himself . ker bang ! that's what it sounds like . not on purpose . i assume accidental .
jack ?
the other guy .
where . how'd you hear that ?
cb . little while ago . one of the boys on the way in picked up jack on the cb calling for state troopers . i figured you'd know what really happened . the fucking guy kill himself ? this twombley , who the fuck is he , anyhow ?
no , i . i've been out on the grader all morning . twombley's summer people . massachusetts . friend of gordon's . it was his idea for jack to take him hunting . i gotta go .
it's called a grilled cheese sandwich , you dub .
his office . you mean my old office .
well , i guess that's what he said .
he got his deer yet ?
no , he's out now . somewhere on the mountain . i'd stay away from him if i were you . he's real pissed .
who are you ?
i was . i'm wade whitehouse . i was wondering , is your husband here ?
he's asleep . we were up very late .
well , yes , i'm . i want to say that i'm real sorry about your father , mrs . twombley .
mrs . gordon . thank you .
well , yeah , i suppose . sure . i just had a little business to settle with mr . gordon . i'm the local police officer .
something about my father ?
oh , no . no , it's a . it's a traffic thing . no big deal .
can't it wait , then ?
whitehouse . next time , phone ahead .
how's that ?
i said , 'next time , phone ahead . '
jesus christ . mr . gordon , when i come all the way to serve somebody a summons , i don't call ahead for an appointment .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i'm issuing you a ticket . moving violation .
moving violation ! i just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket ? now ? are you nuts ? is that it , whitehouse ? you're nuts ?
yesterday morning , you passed a stopped school bus , which was flashing its lights , then you
hold on !
don't ever put your hands on me , mr . gordon .
you're talking about a goddamned ticket , from when i passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something ?
don't give me a hard time , mr . gordon . i'm just
doing your fucking job . i know . i watch television too .
yes . here's your ticket .
you get the hell out of my house now , asshole . and know this you are going to be a lucky asshole if i haven't got you fired before the day is out . i can do it with one phone call , and i'm pissed enough to do it now !
have you been heating the house ? not just with the stove .
there's a furnace .
you're not using it today ?
it's broke i guess . there's an electric in the bedroom .
maybe wade should take a look at it . your pipes'll freeze . wade , would you do that ?
coffee's perked .
when did she die ?
is . ? she's dead then ?
can ?
makes me sad it was her . instead of me . i shoulda froze .
new hat ? jill's up , i see .
for a while .
how's she doing ?
okay . she's fine .
you two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party , give me a call , okay ? i'm off .
see you tomorrow , maybe .
you okay ?
yeah .
you okay ?
yeah .
i'm sorry about what i said .
said what ?
about you and jill and needing a third person . she went back to lillian ?
forget it .
i'm sorry .
i'm going to start one of those custody suits . i don't give a fucking shit . you know ?
you don't mean that .
yeah . i mean that .
no you don't . you're pissed , that's all . you ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with lillian . you know ? work it out with her , tell her how you feel . lillian's not out to get you .
the hell she isn't . lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day i met her . i'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from concord and get this thing , this divorce thing , rearranged . i've been thinking about it a lot . it's like she owns jill or something . nobody owns nobody , especially not kids . and i pay her .
call me .
tonight . let's get together .
okay .
there's something funny about that shooting . there's lots funny about it , actually .
i heard he was drunk at toby's last night and got in a fight with hettie . he drove off without her .
i'm sure , i'm positive it didn't happen the way jack says it did .
. jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry . he used to be a sweet kid , but it's like , when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore , he changed . now he's like everyone else .
i've been wondering if maybe jack shot twombley , instead of twombley shooting himself . i've been wondering maybe jack shot him on purpose .
wade ! how can you even think such a thing ? why would jack hewitt do that , shoot twombley on purpose ?
money .
jack doesn't need money .
everybody needs money . except guys like twombley and that sonofabitch son in law of his . people like that .
jack wouldn't kill for it . besides , who would pay him ?
lots of people . guy like evan twombley , boston union official , probably got lots of people want to see him dead . the government's been investigating his links with the mafia .
the mafia hire jack hewitt ?
no , i just know jack's lying about what happened . he just seemed i know that kid , what he's like inside . he's a lot like i was at his age .
you wouldn't have done anything like that , shot someone for money .
no . not for money . but , if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse i was pretty fucked up , you know .
but not now .
i can see what you looked like as a kid .
you knew me as a kid .
yeah , but never what you looked like . not really . never really studied your face , like now . i was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now , this way .
what way ?
after making love . i like it . it's nice to see that in a grown up person .
it's nice .
i'm her father supposed to be , but i'm not able to . yes . yes , i am . it may be the only thing in my life i've been so clear about wanting . even if it takes a big fight .
then . i guess you have to .
there's another thing i've been thinking about . i don't know how you feel about the idea , margie , because we've never talked about it . but i've been thinking lately , i've been thinking we should get married sometime . you and me .
oh , wade .
i've been thinking about it , that's all .
you've been married twice
it was to the same woman . i was just a kid . it's not like a marriage proposal or anything , just a thought . something for you and me to talk about and think about . you know ?
alright . i'll think about it .
good .
did you tell them ? that we were coming ?
don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents ?
i know your parents .
i just want to pick up my divorce papers . for the lawyer . it won't take long .
are you sure they're home ? did you call ?
the truck's here . looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started .
think they're alright ?
of course ! i would've heard .
how ?
i don't know for christ's sake !
wade .
jesus christ , pop , let's go home . i got waylaid . sorry .
what on earth is happening to you ? why are you acting this way ?
it's my tooth ! my fucking tooth ! i can't even think anymore because of it .
i heard you talking . you got fired this morning , didn't you ?
look , that's temporary , believe me . there's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days , my getting fired by lariviere and merritt won't matter a bit .
i'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up . for the rummage sale . and some things for the cleaners . and the laundromat .
don't lie to me . you're leaving me , i can see that .
don't be silly . hi , jill .
are you okay , wade ? what was wrong ? why were you holding everyone up ?
did you see that sonofabitch in the bmw ? he could've killed somebody .
did you get his number ?
i know who it is .
good . who ?
mel gordon .
i still don't understand
from boston . evan twombley's son in law he was driving . i know where they're headed . up the lake , agaway . the old man's out deer hunting with jack hewitt , so they probably got some big weekend party planned .
where's jill ?
me and jill , we just had a little spat . she felt kind of left out , i guess , from not knowing some of the new kids
where is she now ? is she in the truck with your friends ?
yeah .
she's grown up some , hasn't she ?
oh , jesus , lay off , will you ? it looks like you've won this fucking round already , so lay off a little , for christ's sake .
don't cause a scene . no one's trying to win any 'rounds' . don't make it any worse .
i'm not making it any worse . you are . me and jill could've worked this thing out . it's normal , it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it . believe it or not . how do you think this makes me look , treating her like some tragic victim or something ?
no , not anymore . it's too . it's too far .
we should talk .
we've done all our talking , wade .
it's just .
let the past be . i'm sorry about your mother . i liked her . you never know how much women like that suffer . it's like they live their lives with the sound turned off and then they're gone .
yeah , lots .
see . get your boots .
hi honey .
you make me sick . i can't believe you've sunk so low .
low as what ? what have i done ? it's bad to want to see your own daughter ?
you know what i'm talking about . for what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much . love . you won't get away with it .
we're looking for the funniest costume ! and the scariest ! and the most imaginative ! and the best costume of all !
got here just in time . go ahead . jump in line . maybe you'll win a prize .
watch this snow . it's coming down tonight .
where's the plow ?
jimmy took it . jack's out hunting with evan twombley .
his son in law damn near killed me .
huh ?
at the school crossing . in his bmw . coulda hurt some kids . i'm gonna bust his ass .
don't go playing policeman .
what am i a security guard ? you hired me , you and your selectman friends .
you don't want the extra police pay ?
i'm not saying that .
get the grader . go out past toby's . don't let lillian get to you . she didn't belong here . that's why she left .
fuck you .
that's what i love about a small town . you know everybody .
a hunting accident . jack and twombley .
huh ?
i figured you already heard .
twombley , jesus . we got to get moving i got to get up there . how would i know ? c'mon , you drive . we'll take my truck .
twombley's shot . i heard that . not jack . he's okay , i assume .
fuck . you don't know how bad or anything ?
you mean twombley ?
yes , wade , i mean twombley . put out that cigarette . fuck . fuck . fuck .
he more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something . that's what usually happens .
i shoulda sent you instead of jack .
i wish you had . i'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader .
you ain't the hunter jack is . and he can't drive the grader worth shit .
like hell .
that must've been twombley . jesus . i bet that was twombley .
you want me to follow them to littleton ?
let's get to the top and talk to jack first . he'll know what happened . he fucking better . if this coulda been avoided , i'll put that kid's ass in a sling .
it ain't done , if that's what you mean .
something bugging you ?
yeah . a few things .
well , right now we're not too interested . finish up what you gotta do , then you can get bugged on your own time .
i'm fine , fine .
you rolfe ? i remember you from high school . you're a teacher now ? harvard ?
sorry about the long lunch . my clutch is going out again .
you ever think of getting a new car , wade ?
on what you pay me ?
elaine ! call chub meritt and have him pick up wade's car , fix the clutch .
what do i have to do for it ?
nothing , wade , i've been thinking . you don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little .
i saw mel gordon in here this morning .
so ?
he say anything about the summons i tried to give him ? sonofabitch wouldn't accept it .
wade , that wasn't smart . going out right after the man's father in law shot himself . let it go . call it a favor to me .
you ? why ?
mel's doing some business with me . it's nice to do favors for people you do business with . he was in a hurry . no big deal .
that was before twombley was shot . before he knew .
what's the difference ? take my truck , take a rest stop worrying about mel gordon . have you decided what to do with your old man's place he going to stay there ?
want to buy ?
don't light that in here . i'm allergic .
i won't . you interested ?
maybe .
you and mel gordon ?
could be .
always count on old wade for a good screwing . why should i always pay more , sell cheap ? why should you guys make all the money . you and mel and jack . right's right .
wade , you're done . let me have the shop keys .
you two , don't you get it ? he's using you . you're his slaves . jesus christ , jack , don't you see that ?
the key , wade .
yeah , you can have the key . it's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years . i give it to you with pleasure . now i'm free . see how easy it is , jack ? all you got to do is give back what the man gave you , and you're free of him . i've got to call my brother .
who's fault is it then if it's not yours ? you're the one in charge , daddy .
yeah .
look . those kids are still trick or treating . they're still out .
those are the hoyts .
i don't care . they're out .
can't you see . look out there . nobody's got their porch lights on anymore . it's too late . those hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble . see , they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there . they chopped down herb crane's new bushes . little bastards . jesus h . christ .
why do they do that ?
do what ?
you know .
break stuff ?
yeah . it's stupid .
i guess they're stupid .
did you do that when you were a kid ?
well , yeah . sort of . nothing really mean . me and my pals , me and my brothers . it was kind of funny then . stealing pumpkins , soaping windows . stuff like that .
was it funny ?
to us it was .
but it's not funny now .
it's not funny now . i'm a cop and i gotta listen to all the complaints people make . i'm not a kid anymore . you change .
i bet you did lots of bad things .
what are you talking about ?
i just think you used to be bad .
no . i didn't used to be bad . no sir . where do you get this stuff ? from your mother ?
no . she doesn't talk about you anymore .
go on , jill . some of those kids you still know .
i don't want to .
why ? why not ? you know these kids from when you went to school here . it hasn't been that long .
it's not that .
what then ?
it's stupid .
it's fun .
i want to go home . i don't like it here .
oh , jesus , come on , will you ? don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up . join the other kids . do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam .
no .
no what ?
no i didn't see anybody i know . no i don't want to go to school here tomorrow . i want to go home .
you are home . there are lots of kids you still know here .
i don't want to be here . don't worry , i love you , daddy , i do . but i want to go home .
jesus . listen , jill , tell you what . tomorrow morning , you still want to go home , i'll drive you down . i'll get off work or something .
i called mommy .
what ? you called mommy ? just now ?
yes .
jesus , why ?
i . because i want to go home . she said she'd come and get me .
come and get you ! shit ! it's a damn half hour drive each way . why didn't you talk to me about it first ?
see , i knew you'd be mad .
yeah . yeah , right , i'm mad . what'd you tell her , for christ sake ?
i told her i wanted to come home . daddy , don't be mad at me .
well , i guess i am . i planned this , i planned all this , you know . i mean , it's sort of pathetic , but i planned it . you shouldn't have called your mother . c'mon , we're gonna call her before she leaves .
yes .
that's all you got to say ? yes .
yes .
she won't be here for a half hour . think you can stand it that long ?
yes .
where do you expect to wait for her ? obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough .
that's fine with me too . when mommy comes , tell her i'm up here .
i'm glad you're here . can you stay for a while ?
are we going in this ?
yeah . my car's in the shop . this'll be fine .
it's pretty old .
it belongs to pop .
pop ?
grandpa . my father . it's his .
oh .
how about a big mac ?
mommy won't let me eat fast food . you know that . it's bad for you .
c'mon , we can always sneak a big mac . and a cherry turnover . your favorite . what do you say ?
no .
what do you want , then ?
nothing .
you can't have nothing , jill . we need lunch . mr . pizza ?
same thing , daddy . mommy says
i know what mommy says . i'm in charge today , though .
okay . so we'll get what you want . what do you want ?
nothing , i guess . i guess i can wait till we get home . maybe we'll stop by wickham's for a hamburger when we get to lawford . that suit you ? you always like wickham's .
okay .
fine .
what are you sorry for ?
i don't know . for the food business . i guess . i just thought , you know , we'd sneak a big mac on mommy , like we used to .
i want to go home .
you can't .
that's illegal , you know .
i know .
you're a policeman .
nope . not anymore . i'm nothing anymore .
oh .
jill , please , it's alright . nothing happened .
i want to go home .
okay , let's go home , then .
lariviere's having a hell of a time in there . master of fucking ceremonies .
where's that gun you were bragging on today ?
no brag . just fact .
got you for , bucks ?
relax , chief . we're leaving . you wanna toke ?
you gotta be more careful about that shit . gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you . and i'll be outta a job .
some job . here , have a hit . don't be such a hardass . i know you got problems , but everybody's got problems .
not here .
got a job first thing in the morning , first day of season . saturday i'll hunt for myself . twombley something . er
evan . he's a mucky muck union official from massachusetts . you're lucky .
don't know about lucky . the guy's a full blown asshole . pay's good , though . a day . i got to guarantee a kill , of course . which i can do . there's some monster bucks hiding out up there .
how'd you get the job ?
gordon , he's always got some angle working . he wants to keep twombley happy , i'm his boy .
right . the sonofabitch couldn't get along without me .
yeah , he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him .
right !
bastard's got his high beams on .
shit .
piece of fucking cake .
where'd twombley get shot ?
in the chest .
no , i mean whereabouts .
a half mile in , along the old lumber road .
you bring him up yourself ? that's a steep climb .
the ambulance guys lugged him up .
you stayed away ?
yeah .
where'd you get the blood ?
what blood ?
on your sleeve .
musta . how'd i know ? what're you doing , playing cop ?
i gotta make a report to fish and game . i was just wondering , that's all . what'd he do , to shoot himself , i mean ?
who the fuck knows ? musta slipped or something . i just heard the gun go off .
i never seen a man shot before . not even in the service . must be something .
well , i didn't actually see him do it . like i said .
sure you did .
what ?
saw him do it ?
what the fuck you telling me , wade ? i never seen the guy get shot , i told you that .
you musta seen him get shot . i know you did .
let's get the fuck outta here . you're not making any sense , man .
there's your old twenty gauge , and that there's the new browning you was showing me last night . this must be twombley's gun . brand new . very fancy tooling . probably fired one time . it's a beautiful piece of work . but what the hell , jack , i guess you deserve it . right's right .
yeah .
twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again .
he sure as hell won't .
lawford ?
out of this fucking job . this job sucks . working outside in the winter sucks .
why don't you quit now , you want out so bad ?
open the door . we're late .
i mean it you got enough money now . head out for california . surf's up , jack , and you're digging wells in the snow .
what do you mean i got money ? i'm as broke as you .
it's not enough snow , not for tracking the bastards . no advantage there , kid .
don't worry , mr . twombley , i know where those suckers are . rain or shine , snow or no snow . i know deer . we'll kill us a buck today . guaranteed . before ten .
guaranteed , eh ?
yep . right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles . the bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks . this gun gets fired before ten o'clock . whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you . i'll put you inside , yards of a buck the first four hours of the season . that's what you're paying me for , ain't it ?
damn straight !
done much shooting with that rifle yet ?
tell you what . you get me close to a big buck by ten , kid , there's another hundred bucks in it .
if you get it ?
yeah .
you might not kill it .
you think so .
you might gut shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag . can't guarantee that won't happen , especially with a new gun . i may have to shoot it .
you take care of your end , kid , i'll take care of mine .
mmm .
you understand what i'm saying ? i want a deer , a dead one , not a cripple or whatthefuck .
i get it . no sweat . you'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead . and you'll have him by coffee time .
and you'll get your extra hundred bucks .
wonderful !
i'm okay .
follow close . we'll cross the next meadow .
yeah ?
drafted by the red sox .
you played for the sox ?
double a . new britain .
oh .
pitcher . best ballplayer to come out of new hampshire since carlton fisk .
really .
they said .
hmm .
the only difference between me and that clemens on tv is luck , shit luck .
what happened ?
ruined my arm . brought me along too fast . why'd it have to be my fucking arm , i used to think . then i realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm .
yeah .
this way .
sun's gettin high .
deers have ears too .
you only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks .
you heard the news .
i hear twombley got shot .
yeah .
you see it ?
nope . heard it . we wasn't far apart . i spotted this buck , then i heard the gun go off and twombley was gone . i looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was , deader'n shit . called it right in .
this is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up . twombley's son in law and daughter are up the weekend . didn't you say you'd seen him , wade ?
not exactly . i mean , he never paid me .
you'll get your money . don't talk to any newspapers about this . twombley's a big deal down in massachusetts , you know . tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment .
lawyer ? i don't need no lawyer , do i ?
no , of course not . just say it , that's all .
shit ! what are we gonna do ?
maybe i can buy him off . i gotta talk to mel .
you can't buy wade off .
we bought you .
that was me .
i screwed up the divorce . i agreed with everything she said . i wanted her to like me . i just want to be a good father .
it would help if you were married , if there was someone at home while you work .
i plan to . soon .
how soon ?
this spring .
good . it would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex wife . sexual problems upsetting to the child .
it looks pretty hopeless , don't it ?
no , not exactly . i'll look at the divorce decree , see if we can get it redrawn . interview your daughter . jill , right ?
yes .
fine . i'll need a retainer . you can mail it .
jesus . how much . how much will the whole thing cost ?
hard to say . if we go for custody , depositions , psychiatric evaluations , it could drag on . ten or twelve thousand dollars . she could win on appeal . if we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn , assuming they're unduly restrictive , it wouldn't be more than twenty five hundred .
oh .
you might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the
yeah . i know . the custody suit thing was just my getting back at her . i'm not as dumb as i look . whatever you say . i love my daughter . i'll send you the five hundred .
same old shit .
just tell me when you'll have it fixed .
the bad news is there's a problem with gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night . figured you'd know something about that , wade .
yeah . i know about that .
lariviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car . a couple hundred for the clutch . i got some more bad news . wanna hear it ?
tell me .
chub says you're fired .
he can't fire me . lariviere already did that this morning .
he's a selectman . the town . he said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office . i'm supposed to pull the cb and police light out of your car . they're town property .
you got yourself a computer , alma .
been putting my files into it . you take sugar and milk ?
no . black .
are you alright , wade ?
yeah , sure . why ? i got this damned tooth , i got a few things bugging me , like everybody else . but i'm okay .
well , you look . sad . upset . i don't mean to pry . i'm sorry about your mother . it was a nice funeral .
alma , i think there's some dirty business going on in this town .
always has been .
this is maybe worse than you and i are used to . what i'm talking about , i'm talking about murder . among other things .
who ?
evan twombley , the union boss who got shot . somebody murdered him .
who ?
you know jack hewitt , the kid i work with ?
sometimes things are simpler than you think . let me ask you a question .
you don't believe me ?
about jack ? no . have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately ?
i know he's due for the last two years . i was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in .
has anybody offered to buy it ?
as a mater of fact , yes . lariviere .
this is from three years ago . some difference , huh ?
what is the northcountry development association ?
i went down to concord to check it out . the president is mel gordon . the vice president and treasurer is gordon lariviere . those boys are buying up the mountain , wade . , this year . i believe that's out of lariviere's league .
twombley involved ?
no .
he musta found out . they had to get rid of him . and jack'll get blamed .
all the figures show is that gordon lariviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as selectman . in a year or two , you won't recognize this town .
thank you .
see what ?
the pattern . each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the pole . a line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle .
well , i'll be !
i'll be another !
our 'cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt , itself !
or , perhaps , until he gets us ?
but u answers u are what we need not more questions !
toward the pole !
all right go to it .
remove your weapons , commander . and come here alone !
come where ?
point of view is everything . to us , u your u form of life is ugly as we appear to you .
tell me something why can u i u hear you , when the others couldn't ?
my mission is to study various solar systems , and planets select the most suitable for colonization
for horrors like yourself ?
your friend was to remain where he was !
he did !
i am afraid not . therefore
why not me ? what am i the closing act ?
on the contrary . i want you unharmed perfect .
why ?
i have selected you , to return with me along with several other specimens , for study . we will examine you and the others , discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth colonizers . '
that's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you ?
of course . but it is time to be gin the return voyage
to navigate , won't you have to . see your way ?
obviously .
u that u might be a u little u u rough u !
i did go . just back . reef , these are a couple of our passengers sir ian hunt , and dr . clifford kent . my exec , commander richard holloway .
i met dr . kent , once .
i'm afraid i have some bad news for you , reef you'll have to share quarters , this trip .
who with ?
dr . neilsen . he'll be
'doctor' neilsen ? when did u that u happen ?
huh ?
it'll be all right . we're old friends !
what do you think ?
i think i should have joined the air force !
determine extent of damage , immediately .
after torpedo room report !
take a look .
thirty four seconds !
that's what i said !
but what can we accomplish ?
we can u ram u him !
it's the screws , skipper . at our declination angle , running in reverse , they're pulling the shark u and u cyclops right to the bottom .
and we're at safe maximum depth already . stop engines !
suppose there's an atmosphere , of some kind , inside cyclops ?
what ?
if we could get inside the saucer use our torches maybe we could cut the shark loose ?
nothing we can do , now .
minus three .
it doesn't seem possible , but could it be an electrical storm center ?
under u water u ?
high intensity arcs will burn , submerged . and millions of volts . discharged in random directions .
. above murmansk , and finland .
suppose our theorizing is correct ? then this u could u be the next danger point !
what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit ? perhaps be lying there waiting ?
we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear . but suppose it isn't at all what if it's u magnetic u ?
u we u harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force . maybe cyclops does it on a u super u scale .
the north pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all the earth itself !
. in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and , as you put it . . 'recharging his batteries' ?
if we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted .
what direction does the system indicate ?
there's got to be an explanation !
there is . i believe our friend . cyclops . is returning to life !
as ready as we u can u be ! i'll report to the skipper .
we read you ! go ahead , doctor ! they're inside the saucer . it's filled with breathable air !
wonderful !
that's wonderful , carl ! reef thinks they can clear the shark bow so we can pull ourself loose !
radiation level . constantly rising .
anything
it's possible i could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the icbm so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the pole .
what about time . ?
excuse me , skipper
yes , griff ?
all internal repairs completed , and frogmen report exterior damage minor .
something wrong ?
the inertial navigation system . must have been knocked out in the crash .
why do you say that ?
we're dead in the water . but it indicates we're moving !
what ?
right , skipper .
is there any way out of it ?
seems to be all around .
what about down ?
i . don't know !
course and speed ?
speed . about twenty two knots . course . due north !
what ?
what course , skipper ?
right at our one eyed friend !
the frogmen ?
with their underwater experience , they'll be invaluable . take sidearms , and flare pistols
sidearms ? but the saucer's dead .
we hope !
now , dave old buddy , you know you're exaggerating what do you think of this husband of yours ? on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the exec and his navigation and firing officer . but unfortunately , in the case of lieutenant dave milburn of the tiger shark and myself
but julie's a nice girl , and i've seen you work . she deserves a fighting chance !
helen . i appeal to you
reef !
so they caught up with you , too ?
at the worst possible moment . tomorrow is janie's birthday . poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home . now
u that's u the worst possible moment ?
what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl ?
disappointing a u big u girl !
huh ?
i might have a son like u that ! u
i guess .
one of the finest men , and officers , alive . a real hero in the best sense of the word in world war two . he taught us engineering and design . fought like a demon to develop atom subs .
so ?
so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school , be gins making noises like a pacifist . a real egghead , do gooder , and crackpot ! 'ban the atom tests ! junk the nuclear subs ! spend the mili tary budgetfor peace ! '
a lot of people think like that .
but u they're u not skipper neilsen's son ! it broke his heart . then when some newspapers called carl 'the honest , sincere son of a war mongering father' captain neilsen resigned from the navy . oh , he still keeps his hand in playing around with projects like the 'lungfish' but it broke him , all the same .
have you ever talked to carl tried to see his side ?
'his' side ? i've seen it , all right . a nice , bright yellow !
sounds like it ! distress call , from a small freighter , between ellesmere island and greenland . one mayday , then . nothing .
we're stuck tight !
skipper ! look at the depth gauge !
'us ? '
reef and i can take the explorer down , clamp it around the eye , and
you all wait here . i'm going inside , take a look .
not u alone u , you're not !
what's more important there's our problem . the bow ram the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break . if we can cut the ram , the shark can pull herself loose !
i think you're right .
go back and tell dr . neilsen . have him report to the skipper .
yeah ?
listen ! hear that ?
i don't hear anything . maybe you've been down here too long . why don't you go back up and
strange you didn't hear it . omit f
hey you know somethin' ? it's getting lighter in here !
you know it u is u ?
and if i didn't u know u better i'd swear we were moving !
let's get back to work , and maybe we u will u be , soon .
the sound again ?
somewhere down there ?
wonder where powell and carney are ?
we'll have to look for them later .
i'm with u you ! u
here keep these . it wants me to come alone .
oh it does ?
dave !
what's goin' on in here , lad ? what ?
i should have suspectcd , when i heard that 'doctor . ' i thought it was your father .
it was supposed to be . dad had a heart attack , two days ago .
how is he ?
it was moderate . he'll be all right . but it was out of the question , his coming along .
and they thought u you u could re place the skipper ?
not in two days . look do you think i u wanted u to come ? if it didn't mean so much to dad proving his depth explorer it's the last thing i'd want !
your 'out . ' this came for you .
my father ! he's not ?
dead ? matter of fact , he's much better . he's left the hospital .
what did you mean i'm 'out ? '
your father can be in nome , alaska , tomorrow . we have two choices ask them to send him out in a 'copter' , and take you off , or the shark can put back into nome .
you 'trade school boys' are all alike , aren't you ? anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold braided puppet is , ipso facto , a coward !
u you u said it . but i won't argue
wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage , u commander u ! it just so happens i'm u not u a coward physical or mental and before i'd risk my father's life .
we're u all u risking our lives !
that may be . but dad stays where u he u is , and i'm staying here !
you're really a mixed up oddball , aren't you ?
perhaps . but the idea of willingly going to u school u to spend my u life u at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder lizards i'm referring to war u that u strikes me as the u worst u cowardice of all being spiritually yellow !
you mean u nothing u is worth fighting for ?
peace the dignity of man the destiny of the human spirit ! show me a man who says you win u those u by fighting wars , and u i'll u show you an idiot !
you may not u win u them . but without men like your father , to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them or as much as we have of them they'd have disappeared , u long u ago !
unidentified flying objects .
then . this is a 'flying saucer ? '
that's enough , holloway . i've told you before , wearing boards on your shoulders , and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto matically endow you with back bone !
any more than being the son of captain neilsen does !
however our ideas disagree , as i've said before , i'm u not u a coward ! and it happens you've got no choice either u i u take you down there , in the lungfish , or you don't get there
i'd sooner swim !
they're so remote cold beautiful , the stars . but now i wonder
yes ?
which is the one we have to worry about ?
maybe just 'maybe' when their ship doesn't return they'll decide not to come here , after all .
but if they u do u ?
i don't know .
i wouldn't worry . so long as we have boats like the tiger shark and people like you , the skipper , dave , kent , sir ian and my father
and his 'egghead' son ! we'll give 'em a u rough u u reception u , won't we ?
two hours a day , six days a week .
faint .
mark .
i'm not finished i loved greta . a lot . and if maybe , just maybe , someone or some thing killed her , i'd like to hear about it !
i can't listen to this .
stick around , please ?
you , too ?
he invited me to his house last night .
these things are wild . what do you think ?
makes you look like a nun
yeah .
that means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so i can lock up when i'm done .
have another one , sounds like you need it .
naah , i'm done . got to be on shift in a couple hours . aren't you going in ?
nah . it's getting too cold for me , and my wonderful mother will kill me if i screw up my hair . she's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night .
stop saying that , it's bullshit .
i want to talk about the baby .
look . dan's parents were pushing him . pushing him hard . he was bitching about it at the party last night . he was under pressure . we all are .
pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy .
all of us . right ?
yeah , when are you gonna come to your senses ?
next life . oh , what's that ?
my undying love . have some .
pimples , heartburn , cellulite . and no modeling career .
that club sucks , they card everybody . let's just party at your place .
you know my mother get real . what about alice's ?
he's right . sometimes i feel like i'm living with melicertes .
who ?
oh , he was this ancient guy i read about who like , killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should .
i don't believe this . all that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish ?
give up , mark , it's hopeless .
i think i'm starting to wear her down . have some anyway .
not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis .
greta , come on . one burger with me ?
my dad's got this thing about drinking in the house .
well we gotta do something !
that's why it's my fault dan's dead .
yeah . i'm just aces .
i want to talk to both you guys about greta . and .
i'm very fucking sorry , but greta is dead today . could we interest you in someone else ?
she must've fallen asleep at the table .
then get out !
mark !
do you think i'm an idiot . for being in love with her ?
nobody thinks that .
maybe it was her mother who killed her , with all that polly perfect shit .
it wasn't her mother . the only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party .
tell me some more about this krueger guy .
why don't i go make some coffee . there's a lot to tell .
who's jacob ?
my baby !
what , you named it already ?
i don't know !
i'm going to see what else i can find out about mr . fred krueger
i couldn't do that , mark . he's my last link with dan . no , i want him .
then we'll find another way .
they think i'm nuts .
that's their problem .
no , it's our problem , mark . if i don't deal with this , they really might try to take jacob . you said she committed suicide ?
that's what the newspapers thought . she spent the rest of her life in the asylum . after krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself , so they thought .
meaning ?
they couldn't prove it . no body ! nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business .
but i've seen her grave .
empty plot . memorial stone . vacant . they never did put her under . cool , huh ?
poor woman .
no shit .
i don't understand .
she killed herself . her soul's gonna be in torment .
hey , what's wrong with you let's see a smile .
had kind of a long night .
dan keeping you up again ? put a lock on that window , girl .
no , the dan part was nice .
yeah , before they revoke his diploma .
it was no accident . it was krueger . he used to get in through my dreams , but not anymore . he's found some other way .
alice , it's no dream . i'm sorry . dan's dead .
have you visited the little boy on my floor ? jacob , the one who looks kind of sad ?
there aren't any little boys on your floor .
he must've wandered up from the children's ward . i just wondered what was wrong with him .
they're waiting for us . but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me .
what's that got to do with it ?
when dan died you weren't even asleep . you said so . end of story .
no accident . i tried to warn all of you about krueger .
why don't you two stick to reality .
i think krueger's trying to do something to it .
oh , alice . no . honey , i love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself .
mark knows i'm not crazy . ask him to show you his hands .
i really think you need to calm down now , okay ?
i just can't figure out how he's getting in when i'm awake .
i am your friend , and i'm worried sick about you . but , you're like a locked safe . you've gotta start dealing with reality .
krueger is reality .
and so is your baby . you've got more than just yourself to think of now !
what do you think i'm doing ? look . whether you believe it or not , krueger is back . he's after the baby and if i don't try to do something about it , who will ?
all i know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman . why don't you take off leave springwood and cool out somewhere for a while ?
goddamn it , yvonne ! you don't just run away from this guy ! he finds you in your dreams .
look . we're all tired . none of us had any sleep since friday night .
that's the only reason you're alive .
yeah . so that's him . and you're not crazy .
if they actually bothered to bury her .
what ?
jacob . we've got to get to amanda before it's too late .
but how are we gonna
we've got to go to the asylum and find her body . mark said her soul's trapped with it that's why she can't come to me . it must be !
you do good work , alice .
so did dan .
he sure loves to stay awake .
that's okay . he's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep .
i watched from behind the stands . didn't want to embarrass you , ya know . the drunk showed up , that kind of thing .
that's in the past . unless you've stopped going to the meetings .
no . a deal's a deal .
dad !
it's the model you've been saving up for . i wanted you to have it for your trip .
to take a picture .
you sure you don't want a ride to work ?
it's just across the park .
i'm so sorry , honey .
daddy , he's coming back . krueger's coming back . make them understand .
sobering .
very funny .
alice .
since when are you such a smart shopper ?
since my little girl became a mom .
you disappointed in me ?
no , i'm not . i sort of hope it's a boy . be nice to have a boy playing in the house again .
i've got to go .
no ! i won't have you running around in the middle of the night . you're coming home .
but dad
now .
hi , beautiful .
jesus ! don't do that !
sorry , babe .
the tickets .
they're coach seats , but the plane lands in paris . it's gonna be a helluva summer , hon !
i know .
okay , babe . what's the matter ?
nothing . it's just . i didn't see my father at the ceremony .
he'll show up . c'mon , what's really wrong ?
no . well , not exactly . it's that . i felt like i wasn't in control . for the first time since . all that . i'm scared .
you stopped it didn't you ? it was probably just a regular bad dream .
yeah . i guess .
you don't dream him up , he can't hurt you . or me . or us . remember .
you're right .
there you go . love you .
me too .
hey . wake up .
huh ?
it's lonely in there , in my room .
my name is .
i'm sorry your boyfriend got killed .
how did you know that ?
i could tell you were sad . i just wanted to see if you were all right .
hi , you don't look very well . are you feeling all right ?
been having bad dreams .
is that who you're waiting for ?
no .
i don't think this is a nice place for you to be . maybe we should go find your mom .
she doesn't want me around
oh . i'm sure that's not true . i'll bet she's very worried about you . i would be .
no you're not . you don't even care about being a mom . how come you don't think about me ?
who said i . wait , what ?
my friend , with the funny hand .
come on downstairs . he won't hurt you . he needs us both .
he's inside you , where he hides .
what do you mean ?
it's where he hides out . inside . that's how he found me .
but how . ?
he says it's easy . especially with sad people . with closed off people .
excuse us , dear .
it's okay , dan
frankly , dear , we wondered what you intend to do with our baby ?
what i what ? well , i've thought about it . i plan to keep him .
and ours . it's our grandchild .
what are you talking about ? my condition ? .
we know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here .
you're not taking my baby !
yeah . i guess so . what happened ?
you had a nasty bump .
i gotta get out of here .
you just stay put . you need rest .
you don't get it , he's after me .
don't worry , honey
something wrong with the stairs ?
avoid all contact day .
what ?
when dad's popping aspiring like popcorn , it's avoid all contact day .
oh god ! he killed them !
i though freddy was just an old town story .
it's no story . it happened . freddy's real and he's back .
i'll tell you later .
it's no just a house . it's his home . he's waiting there for me . to dream .
it's okay , babe . we're with you .
i told you you can't help . this isn't a normal nightmare . i'm doomed .
something the matter with the cuisine ?
well mom , i'll tell ya , when two of your friends die the same day , you let me know what it does to your appetite .
you're just tired . don't think i haven't noticed your not sleeping . that has to stop , honey .
what's wrong with me ?
your distraught . it'll help .
sorry ! sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me . in case you haven't been keeping score , it's his fucking banquet , and i'm the last course !
honey , we went over this in therapy .
mother , you've just murdered me . take that to your goddamn therapy .
t t thanks alice .
earth to alice .
hey , rick !
excuse me , ladies . i'll just be a moment .
i don't get it .
let me talk to you .
so what's up ? what'd i miss ?
she told us the story of freddy . it's a town legend . he was a child killer who was freed on a technicality .
so ?
it pissed off a lot of parents . according to kristen , they hunted him down roasted him alive .
nice neighborhood .
now it gets weird . she says he comes back in dreams . if he kills you there , you're dead for real .
hey man , we're all sorry .
she knew she was gonna die .
how she doing ? i ran into her last night .
she's blaming herself for sheila . i know how it feels . i've been thinking about kristen . maybe i could've stopped it , if i'd listened .
about freddy ?
what else ? you ever look over this town's history ? not a safe place to be a teenager . anyway , if i'm next , watch your back .
rick , please .
alright , i think i see salvation .
i think sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them .
give her time . beauty is skin deep .
it was freddy .
enough of that crap .
i saw it . it was my dream . i brought sheila in .
you're his sister , right ?
rick stayed later after school with kristen . she wasn't feeling very well .
tell him i was looking for him , okay ? i'm dan .
i know . uh . alice .
i thought it was an accident . smoking in bed .
it was no suicide . it was not an accident . it was freddy , and he's coming back for seconds , thirds , and fourths .
in her dream ?
no , don't ! i gave sheila to him and now she's dead !
kristen's story really got to her .
i've been working double shifts .
extra money , huh ?
look , you know why , you just don't believe me .
no offense , or anything , but it's kind of hard to swallow .
the story is , the deaths you can't argue with .
how long have you been awake ?
three days .
alright , let's assume this whole thing is true . why does freddy all of a sudden need you ?
kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy . maybe freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me . someone to bring them to him .
is there something we can do ?
i don't think so . i guess this is my own war .
why can't we just talk to the authorities ?
yeah , right . let's trade death by freddy for life in a rubber room . adults won't see it . they can't .
then what else can we do ?
try what other kids did . keep each other awake . we'll meet at debbie's tonight . at least if we don't sleep he can't get us .
who ?
he's going after debbie , i gotta stop him .
hey , you're not alone . we have to stop him , i'm with you .
you just feel sorry for me .
cut that shit out . maybe before , but not now . i want to help you . i'm on your side .
it's okay , we're just about there .
you know , i get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before .
here we are .
something's wrong here . it feels like .
debbie . she's gone . i've . collected her , like the others .
you look great !
save it for later . come on !
i gotta get to the library before it closes . killer physics test .
i know . i hardly have any time to study .
maybe you shouldn't be working here so much . you don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life .
i know .
ohhhhbaby , i am dead on my feet .
we have matching luggage .
what ?
you've been up all night ?
that obvious , huh ?
then you saw him , too ?
saw who ? i was up all night cramming for this physics test , and i was putting this little baby together . look .
here you are . where were you this morning ? rick's looking all over for you .
have you seen joey and kincaid ! god , i can't find them . i can't find them anywhere .
i'm sure they're around .
yeah , i'm not so sure .
i love to dream , i just hate ones about my dad .
you could do worse .
my mom taught me when i was little . did you ever hear of the dream master ?
sounds like a game show host to me .
no really , it's a fable . the 'guardian of good' dreams . it was like my teddy bear when i was growing up .
great , you wouldn't happen to know his phone number ?
i daydream . you have to dream about some place fun . remember you're in control .
how'd you learn so much about dreams ?
when they're all you have , you kinda become an expert .
when i used to have nightmares . i brought my friends in to help me . until they all started dying .
kristen , what happened ?
you'll hear all kinds of stories . they'll tell you it was murder , but it wasn't .
don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose ?
what ?
the mirror . you can't see yourself in it .
i don't want to .
yeah . she'd be half as strict as you .
but she wouldn't let dad treat me like that .
look , you gotta stand up for yourself . learn to fight back .
rick . i can't .
never say can't . just do what i do .
what's wrong ?
kincaid and joey died last night .
what ?
you alright ?
kristen .
i heard you screaming . was it a bad one ?
it was bad .
doesn't the dream master work for you anymore ?
i can't find him .
hey , since when do you play thomas edison ? this looks like sheila's .
it is . was . it's a zapper , it might help me stay awake .
yeah , or turn you into toast .
i can't go back to sleep again .
i haven't slept much either . since kristen .
figure it out ? ! ? ! i'll be insane before i figure it out . the only thing i'm sure of is that i can't go to sleep . not while he's using me .
then we'll stay up together .
excellent . we accept mastercard and american express .
cash .
alright . may i have your phone number , area code first ?
no , you may not .
okay . fine .
yeah , i know the spiel . if you could bag it , i'll be on my way , thank you .
certainly , sir .
your son in law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day , saw that woman every night . the specifics are in the report , and information about the woman . it's unpleasant , i know . i apologize .
none too discreet , is he ?
no , sir , he is not .
he's an imbecile . i tried to warn my daughter , but what can you do ?
the um . you'll find my invoice in the envelope . if that's all .
yes , mister welles , thank you .
certainly , senator . if i can ever be of further assistance .
yes . i remember mary
you . you do ? you're sure ? please , sister , will you take another look , make sure .
yes . i remember her .
i'm trying to find out . she was a runaway . i'm looking into it for her parents .
those are her belongings .
her belongings ?
that's her suitcase . i had forgotten it , till you showed me her picture .
whatever possessed you to keep this all this time ?
she was the kindest , sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet . oh , i adored her . i supposed i always hoped she'd be back . after a time , all i could do was pray she had moved on to better things . can you get this suitcase to her parents , if you think it's appropriate ?
i'll do what i can .
yes . ?
hello , mrs . mathews , my name's thomas jones , i'm a state licensed investigator .
i don't understand , who are . ?
i'm sorry , let me explain , the r . c . m . p . is a support organization and archive , not unlike the center for missing and exploited children in washington . i'm sure you've dealt with them before ?
yes , but .
these volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected , functioning hand in hand with law enforcement . the r . c . m . p . brought me in to review their investigations . . fact check their records , see if there's anything they missed , anything they should be doing different . i'm here for a few days , before i head back up to virginia . these reports go to the justice department eventually . i spoke to your f . b . i . contact a few days ago , uh .
neil . neil cole .
right , agent cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me . he didn't call ?
no .
well , i'm following up on your daughter , mary , height five four , weight hundred ten pounds , brown eyes , blonde hair . born april , . missing june th , . a runaway , that's how she's listed . is this information correct . ?
they hired you . you're like , a private detective ?
that's exactly what i am .
i didn't think there were private detectives anymore , except on tv .
you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat . drinking whiskey , chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses . want to know what it's really like ? it's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight , pissing in a plastic bottle , pardon me , because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him . glamorous , huh ? and the guy who hired you , he has a hair lip , dandruff and crooked teeth , and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating , and you don't blame her .
no .
she just seemed . depressed . ?
she didn't seem herself . for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it . one night we went to bed . the next morning she was gone . she took some clothes .
what was she running from ?
